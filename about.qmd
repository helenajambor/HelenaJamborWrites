Helena Jambor is a **Visual data communication** scientists & lecturer for bioinformatics.

I am a molecular biologist with a passion for design. After completing a PhD at EMBL, I worked with multi-dimensional datasets composed of images and genome-scale data at the <a hef="https://www.mpi-cbg.de/research/researchgroups/currentgroups/pavel-tomancak/research-focus">Max-Planck Dresden</a>. While a scholar at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Berlin I started seriously researching data visualisation practices in life science and today combine my expertise with large data sets and my interest in data communication.

Today, I work as a scientist at the University Hospital Dresden with visualizations for medical data communication. Since 2019, I lecture biomedical data science at Berlin Hochschule f√ºr Technik and teach data visualization whereever someone needs me.

I blogs, tweets, and writes about all aspects of data visualisation.
