Helena Jambor is a **Visual data communication** scientists & lecturer for bioinformatics.

I am a molecular biologist with a passion for design. After completing a PhD at EMBL, I worked with multi-dimensional datasets, images and genome-scale data at the Max-Planck Dresden. While a scholar at the Wissenschaftskolleg (Institute for Advanced Studies) Berlin I started seriously researching data visualisation practices in life science and today combine my expertise with large data sets and my interest in data communication.

I work as a scientist at the University Hospital Dresden testing visualizations that help health data communication. Since 2019 I lecture biomedical data science at Berlin Hochschule f√ºr Technik and I teach data visualization whereever someone needs me.

I blogs, tweets, and writes about all aspects of data visualisation.
