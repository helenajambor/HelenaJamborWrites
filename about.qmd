Helena Jambor is a **Visual data communication** scientists & lecturer for bioinformatics.

I am a molecular biologist with a passion for design. After completing a PhD at the [EMBL](https://www.embl.org/sites/heidelberg/), I worked with multi-dimensional datasets composed of images and genome-scale data at the [Max-Planck Dresden](https://www.mpi-cbg.de/research/researchgroups/currentgroups/pavel-tomancak/research-focus). While a scholar at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Berlin I started researching data visualisation in the life science and today combine my expertise with large data sets and my interest in data communication.

Today, I work as a scientist at the University Hospital Dresden with visualizations for medical data communication. Since 2019, I lecture biomedical data science at Berlin Hochschule f√ºr Technik and teach data visualization whereever someone needs me.

I blog, tweet, and writes about all aspects of data visualisation.
