Helena Jambor is a Data Visualization scientist & lecturer. 

I trained as a molecular biologist but also took art classes. After my PhD at the [EMBL](https://www.embl.org/sites/heidelberg/), I worked with multi-dimensional datasets composed of images and genome-scale data at the [Max-Planck Dresden](https://www.mpi-cbg.de/research/researchgroups/currentgroups/pavel-tomancak/research-focus). Since my scholarship lar at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Berlin, I research data visualization in the life science and now combine my expertise with large data sets and my interest in data communication.

Today, I am a scientist at the University Hospital Dresden designing visualizations for medical data communication. Since 2019, I lecture biomedical data science at Berlin Hochschule f√ºr Technik and teach data visualization wherever someone needs me.

I blog, tweet, and write about all aspects of data visualization.
