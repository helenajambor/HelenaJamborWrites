    "text": "Last week I visualized the days I did sports in 2017 by hand with illustrator. Most of the time, we want however re-tell similar data (I am not giving up sports anytime soon!), so I always look for ways to create visualizations computationally, for example in R. Therefore, today, I show you how to make a viz of data on days of a year in R.\n\nFirst step: googling (or: duckduck-ing) to find a package other people use for this type of visualization. To my surprise, this took a very long time! Apparently, there is no default package in R that can visualize calendar data!? I found a very laborious solution that someone made with ggplot (referenced here: https://www.r-bloggers.com/ggplot2-time-series-heatmaps/), but it was &gt; 10 lines of code. I then stumbled upon another package, made specifically for visualizing pollutants in air (!), but it works also for other data and is straightforward to use. “openair” takes any dataframe with a “date”-column in the standard format (YYYY-MM-DD) and plots whatever you define as the “pollutant”. In my case, the days I did sports were the “pollutant”.\n3 easy steps:\n\nOpen your data in R, I called my dataframe “sports”.\nThen load library(openair)\nPlot:\n\ncalendarPlot(sports, pollutant = sports, year = 2017)\nVoila!  Red: days I did sports, yellow: lazy days, white: sick days."

    "text": "At some point in her life, a girl’s gotta start with sports to stay healthy and fit when getting older. Did you know that the number of cells in a brain increases when exercising, and that bones stay strong when close to trained muscles (they actually get signaling molecules telling them to stay young!)? My 2017 New year’s resolution was therefore to do sports as often as possible.\nAs I am in love with data, I tracked my progress daily. You can see that I increased from doing sports around 50% of the days to a whopping 90% in July. In January and February, before I was keeping the diary, it was well below half of the days. Clearly, it is easier to run, swim etc. in summer, and I could not keep this up. It was challenging when traveling and on days with a lot of evening appointments and work (November). Most of the days without sports were when I had visitors!\nInitially I also tracked exercise time and what kind of sports I did, but that got too tiring and too complicated. But I did track other parts of my life such as my mood (hint: boring dataset, mainly correlates with female cycle!), my food and my alcohol intake. Interestingly, there is no correlation between sports and alcohol. I do not drink on those days that I feel too miserable for sports. Some days I drank a sip (light grey, a small sherry or so) after my sports, some days I neither drank nor did sports.\nSince I use my diary regularly, I of course tracked all this data on paper: \nI thought a lot about how to present it best, and at the end of the day, I really wanted to showcase my daily routine – this is why the final visualization does not look very different. I only added a bar chart summarizing the data.\nI started out making a dot for each day in a simple table format: \nThen I adjusted the number of days and numbered them to have a week-like format. Sticking to standard practice: labeling 1, 8, 15 is of course counter-intuitive, so I quickly changed this to 7/14/21.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nI then added the actual data: empty space for days without sports, a circle for days I did sports, and a cross for sick days.  Having completed the data visualization, I then started the graphic design part – decluttering wherever possible, playing with color and adjusting layout If necessary. For example, the table like boxes were not necessary at all. What about the lines separating weeks? They are ugly, even in grey!, but some guide is needed to wade through the days. The Gestalt principles show that white space is more effective in grouping that lines and boxes. To discriminate between ‘no sports’ and white space, I changed the white data points to a light grey.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nAll right, looking better! Now some more details… I added a summarizing bar chart of the percentage of days I did sports (not counting sick days), added titles, axis labels, tick marks, and I also showed the data for the months in which I tracked my alcohol consumption. \nAt last – and always at last only! – I added color, and I am in love with blue."

    "title": "How to… Tables",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Tables are one of the most successful visualizations in the history of science. They existed long before charts were invented. Friedrich Miescher reported the discovery of nucleic acids in a small table with just three rows. Janni Nusslein-Volhardt and Eric Wieschaus compiled their observations that gene expression controls embryogenesis in a table. And the seminal discovery that cells are enclosed by a lipid bilayer warranted a full-page table: Today, tables are still common in scientific papers and presentations today. I just counted around that 14 articles in a recent issue of nature had some kind of table. Simple tables are often relegated to the supplemental section. In the main section, tables come in fancier formats and disguise as heatmaps, HiC plots, or databases.\n\n \n\n\n\n\nWhen a figure is done well, it provides us instant insight to the main message and visually guides us with thick lines, tall bars, patterns in a scatter plot etc to the key data. Tables on the other hand just show text and numbers in an organized form. When reading a table, we use it as text; we read from top left, to bottom right. And this is the intention of a table: it presents a complete dataset without a punchy, key message. Tables force the reader to come up with their own conclusion based on the entire data points. This means they need quite a bit of space and are more work to our audiences.\nDespite its disadvantages, a table is very useful for reporting precise numbers, and for in detail comparisons. Tables are also great for presenting large datasets, in which every member of our audience is interested in a different aspect of the data. For example, each reader of the table below (ERC starting grants per country) will look for their country of interest first. If however you have a clear message, e.g., show which country gets most ERCs, use a bar chart (sort bars by size!), or when you show statistical summaries pick one of  the many chart types for this purpose.\n\n\n\n\nBecause tables are organized text, alignment and typography are critical for their legibility, and good legibility allows faster reading.\n\n\nWhich data is used as the key for presenting the result? This goes to the first column of every row. In our case these are the country names. All observations for this country, ERC grants, population, funding rate, get a column each.\n\n\n\nText is best left aligned, where we start reading text. Numbers are right aligned to make comparisons by digits along a column easier. Note: each column header is aligned with its content. That means the header for a text column is left aligned, the header for a number column right aligned.\n\n\n\n\nChoosing a legible font is always great, but really critical for numbers. To be legible, all numbers should have the same height (“new style”) and the same width (“tabular/monospace”). The width is important to compare digits within columns, the same height (so no ascenders and descenders in numbers) looks overall less cluttered.\nIt is not possible to make easy recommendation for a specific font since they are modified depending on the operating system and program. For example, Arial has proportional characters which would not work for numbers in a table. Microsoft Word/Mac has adapted the numbers to be tabularized, while Adobe illustrator/Mac has not.\n\n\n\n\nTo best compare numbers in a column, they should have the same decimal points. This helps the alignment and the understanding. In general, it is always worth considering if the decimals are even important: number of grants does not warrant a decimal because it can only be a whole number. Same for humans, but humans in millions might be reasonably presented with one decimal.\n\n\n\n\nWith the above rules, you usually end up with an organized and legible table. But good news is, you can do more! Removing left and right boarders is fantastic to create extra space and use the entire width of a table cell for the content – sometimes rather important for grants!\nYou can do still more. The minimalist Edward Tufte even says ‘every pixel should have a meaning’. In this spirit, removing all gridlines works often just as fine. Often the well-aligned content is sufficient to guide the eye through columns and rows.\n\nVery long tables however are hard to read without any guides. Two options exist. Either, the content may be grouped into blocks of 5 or 10 rows each. The blocks are then visually separated by white space from each other. Alternatively, the table could include a horizontal gridline every 5 or 10 rows.\n\n\n\n\nLast, and only last, think also about color (black and grey are colors too!). I personally like highlighting table headers by giving them a fill color. Usually a light grey works fine, but this very much depends on the overall presentation and the purpose. If shown on a beamer, some light greys don’t work anymore. Also think of color code (and never mix red and green). I consistently used pink, so using the same color for the header would maybe give it a coordinated look. If your fill color is dark, you have to think about white labels. And they in turn requires larger fonts to achieve equal legibility.\n\n\n\n\n\nHeatmap A heatmap is a matrix/table in which the cells are shaded according to a color-scale representing the an observed value. They are particularity used to represent many-to-many comparison. Heatmaps can display very large matrices in at a very small scale and allow us to rapidly compare numbers and even see coherent patterns in the data. Heatmaps may also be combined with clustering algorithms (or simple sorting by value), which facilitates seeing patterns in data. Heatmaps are not useful to get precise numbers.\nMicroarrays A heatmap that informs about gene expression levels across samples. Gene expression is shown as relative expression compared to a ground truth state. Up-regulation is shown in green, downregulation in red (microarrays are thus not color-blind safe).\nHiC plot HiC plots show heat maps where each pixel represents counts for DNA interactions between two genomic regions. The pixel intensity indicates the number of reads (one color scale) or the divergence of reads from a control (dual color scale). The axes each show the genomic regions that are compared, usually binned to e.g. 1Mb.\nDatabase Online formats of tables to present a large dataset.\nTable-Chart hybrid A table with several observations in columns and one of the observations being presented as small chart (dotplot, boxplot, barplot) adjacent to the respective row. The chart-column usually highlights a particularly important observation."

    "text": "The #30DayChartChallenge is an annual festival for chart-lovers around the world. There is a daily visualization challenge and participants submit their contributions online. Datasets, data analysis, tools, and presentation is entirely up to the participant. All entries are posted on twitter along with a hashtag for the day, from #Day1 to #Day30. The resulting diversity and personal interpretations are the charm of the challenge and a joy to data scientists and visualizers alike.\n\n\n\n\n    All charts\n\n\n\n\n\nI personally was looking for an excuse to get back to making charts with R. All I could think of at the time was however the war in Ukraine. My granddad Anton Jámbor was born and raised in Khust, Zakarpatia Oblast, which was another reason to finally educate myself about Ukraine. So, I made a plan and almost completed it! I researched the people and population of Ukraine, the country and cities, and a little bit the health data since my day-job is in medical research at the University hospital.\nFrom idea to implementation:\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the course of April I completed 18 of the 30 challenges. Many times I made several solutions and tested many more. Below is the example for Kazimir Malevich. I plotted the color-schemes he used in his paintings over his lifetime and tried our several options, including an animation.\nKazimir Malevich was born in Ukraine and is famous for monochrome,abstract paintings. However, that was a brief period, before and after his paintings are full of colors! I analyzed his color-usage over his lifetime. This was one of the few datasets I created myself.  Malevich’s colors from early to late periods as bar charts\n Malevich’s colors from early to late periods as pie charts\n Malevich’s colors animated\nFinding time each day for a full month was impossible with Easter vacation and care work requiting my attention. Now, in a calm summer, I finally completed five more challenges for which I had already found data. I posted these final entries on Ukraine’s Independence Day, coinciding with 6 months since the war starts.\n\n\n\nMy goal was to create a visually and thematically cohesive work. I plan to use my charts for teaching purposes and for teaching the many ways how we can communicate data with charts. Most of my time, as always, was spend on finding a topic for which a dataset was available. A lot of time was also consumed by data wrangling and getting it in a format to actually make charts. And only a fleeting moment for creating the visualizations. That’s how it goes!\nEnjoy my charts, Slava Ukraini and keep Ukraine in the news!"

Today, graphical abstracts are widely used as a thumbnail/preview of online publications and also found at posters, on lab websites, and in research grant applications. The key element of every graphical abstract are the visuals - pictograms, icons, or images. Text, arrows and lines then combine the visual elements into a narrated story, and color highlights key elements or encodes quantities. I summarized a few key points to consider before designing a graphical abstract.\n\n\n\nExample Graphical abstracts for a paper (left) and a grant (right). Left from: Saenz lab \n\n\n\n\nAll graphical abstract have key visuals and usually these are icons, pictograms or symbols, less common are iconic microscope or photographic pics or charts. Pictograms can be illustrations, constructed from simple shapes, but mostly are found in icon libraries. Many icon libraries are free and some can also be used without attribution (public domain). In libraries, icons can be downloaded as PNG or SVG file. PNG, Portable Network Graphic, is a raster-graphics format for lossless data compression. PNGs are ready to use on the web or in software, but are not adaptable. SVG, Scalable Vector Graphic, is a vector images format that can be used interactively on the web, adapted with graphic software, and also used as image as is.

Very neat, you can request support and icons!\nReactome started a collection of scientific pictograms and chemical drawings for free re-use and encourages the upload of user-designed pictograms for sharing with the scientific community. I have not seen it grow much, wonder where it will go.\n\nWhen selecting icons for a graphical abstract make sure all icons have an overall similar appearance: same line-width, colors, and level of detail. Many times icon libraries have a design team to ensure this, but open libraries collect pictograms from various designers with quite distinct appearance. When you want to adapt icons to match in style, get the SVG file which is adaptable with e.g., Inkscape or Illustrator.\n\n\n\nWhat not to do: icons are not matched in style\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to do: mix icons that have overall similar appearance\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen a key visual should show data in the form of a chart, it is advisable to stick to the most common chart types, bar, line, pie chart or scatter plots. Most readers are familiar with these and they are founded on our core visual perception abilities, comparing lengths, angles, or slopes. For all charts ensure that only a few categories or data points are included and details, tick marks, axis label, legends, are omitted.\n\n\n\nSimple Charts that may be used in Graphical Abstracts\n\n\nComplex charts should only be used if they have e.g. iconic status to indicate a specific method was used: in life sciences t-SNE often symbolize single cell data was obtained, and red/green heatmaps indicate microarray data.\nA good overview of chart types and their use is summarized in data viz catalogues (e.g., The Data Visualisation Catalogue)\n\n\n\nGraphical abstracts can be prepared with the same software also used for posters and figures. Many of you will use PoswerPoint. Suitable vector-design software are:\n\nAdobe Illustrator (commercial)\nCorelDraw (commercial)\nAffinity Designer (commercial)\nopen-source: Inkscape - this sweet readers, has direct link to many icon libraries (newest version)! Go to File &gt; Import Web Image &gt; select library.\n\nVector-based graphics programs allow zooming in and out without quality loss. For most graphical abstracts PowerPoint will also produce sufficient results when slides are adjusted in size and exported as vector graphics, e.g., as PDF. To prevent pixelation select that images are not compressed in the options. A big plus of the open source Inkscape: it keeps getting better. Newest feature: direct import of icons from web-based icon libraries via “Import Web Image” tab. This works already for Bioicons and Reactome via dropdown. Also possible in Inkscaoe: script-based image processing, and script-based chart preparation. Another plus, Inkscape relies on the web vector format SVG and is thus readable by browsers and other vector graphics programs.\n\n\n\nA popular, however increasingly costly option are Biorender and MindtheGraph, that have annual subscription plans. Biorender has many sample templates for a quick start and vast icons for life sciences, but you must regularly check the licenses as they are constantly adapted.

    "text": "At some point in her life, a girl’s gotta start with sports to stay healthy and fit when getting older. Did you know that the number of cells in a brain increases when exercising, and that bones stay strong when close to trained muscles (they actually get signaling molecules telling them to stay young!)? My 2017 New year’s resolution was therefore to do sports as often as possible.\nAs I am in love with data, I tracked my progress daily. You can see that I increased from doing sports around 50% of the days to a whopping 90% in July. In January and February, before I was keeping the diary, it was well below half of the days. Clearly, it is easier to run, swim etc. in summer, and I could not keep this up. It was challenging when traveling and on days with a lot of evening appointments and work (November). Most of the days without sports were when I had visitors!\nInitially I also tracked exercise time and what kind of sports I did, but that got too tiring and too complicated. But I did track other parts of my life such as my mood (hint: boring dataset, mainly correlates with female cycle!), my food and my alcohol intake. Interestingly, there is no correlation between sports and alcohol. I do not drink on those days that I feel too miserable for sports. Some days I drank a sip (light grey, a small sherry or so) after my sports, some days I neither drank nor did sports.\nSince I use my diary regularly, I of course tracked all this data on paper: \nI thought a lot about how to present it best, and at the end of the day, I really wanted to showcase my daily routine – this is why the final visualization does not look very different. I only added a bar chart summarizing the data.\nI started out making a dot for each day in a simple table format: \nThen I adjusted the number of days and numbered them to have a week-like format. Sticking to standard practice: labeling 1, 8, 15 is of course counter-intuitive, so I quickly changed this to 7/14/21.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nI then added the actual data: empty space for days without sports, a circle for days I did sports, and a cross for sick days.  Having completed the data visualization, I then started the graphic design part – decluttering wherever possible, playing with color and adjusting layout If necessary. For example, the table like boxes were not necessary at all. What about the lines separating weeks? They are ugly, even in grey!, but some guide is needed to wade through the days. The Gestalt principles show that white space is more effective in grouping that lines and boxes. To discriminate between ‘no sports’ and white space, I changed the white data points to a light grey.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nAll right, looking better! Now some more details… I added a summarizing bar chart of the percentage of days I did sports (not counting sick days), added titles, axis labels, tick marks, and I also showed the data for the months in which I tracked my alcohol consumption. \nAt last – and always at last only! – I added color, and I am in love with blue."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Tables are one of the most successful visualizations in the history of science. They existed long before charts were invented. Friedrich Miescher reported the discovery of nucleic acids in a small table with just three rows. Janni Nusslein-Volhardt and Eric Wieschaus compiled their observations that gene expression controls embryogenesis in a table. And the seminal discovery that cells are enclosed by a lipid bilayer warranted a full-page table: Today, tables are still common in scientific papers and presentations today. I just counted around that 14 articles in a recent issue of nature had some kind of table. Simple tables are often relegated to the supplemental section. In the main section, tables come in fancier formats and disguise as heatmaps, HiC plots, or databases.\n\n \n\n\n\n\nWhen a figure is done well, it provides us instant insight to the main message and visually guides us with thick lines, tall bars, patterns in a scatter plot etc to the key data. Tables on the other hand just show text and numbers in an organized form. When reading a table, we use it as text; we read from top left, to bottom right. And this is the intention of a table: it presents a complete dataset without a punchy, key message. Tables force the reader to come up with their own conclusion based on the entire data points. This means they need quite a bit of space and are more work to our audiences.\nDespite its disadvantages, a table is very useful for reporting precise numbers, and for in detail comparisons. Tables are also great for presenting large datasets, in which every member of our audience is interested in a different aspect of the data. For example, each reader of the table below (ERC starting grants per country) will look for their country of interest first. If however you have a clear message, e.g., show which country gets most ERCs, use a bar chart (sort bars by size!), or when you show statistical summaries pick one of  the many chart types for this purpose.\n\n\n\n\nBecause tables are organized text, alignment and typography are critical for their legibility, and good legibility allows faster reading.\n\n\nWhich data is used as the key for presenting the result? This goes to the first column of every row. In our case these are the country names. All observations for this country, ERC grants, population, funding rate, get a column each.\n\n\n\nText is best left aligned, where we start reading text. Numbers are right aligned to make comparisons by digits along a column easier. Note: each column header is aligned with its content. That means the header for a text column is left aligned, the header for a number column right aligned.\n\n\n\n\nChoosing a legible font is always great, but really critical for numbers. To be legible, all numbers should have the same height (“new style”) and the same width (“tabular/monospace”). The width is important to compare digits within columns, the same height (so no ascenders and descenders in numbers) looks overall less cluttered.\nIt is not possible to make easy recommendation for a specific font since they are modified depending on the operating system and program. For example, Arial has proportional characters which would not work for numbers in a table. Microsoft Word/Mac has adapted the numbers to be tabularized, while Adobe illustrator/Mac has not.\n\n\n\n\nTo best compare numbers in a column, they should have the same decimal points. This helps the alignment and the understanding. In general, it is always worth considering if the decimals are even important: number of grants does not warrant a decimal because it can only be a whole number. Same for humans, but humans in millions might be reasonably presented with one decimal.\n\n\n\n\nWith the above rules, you usually end up with an organized and legible table. But good news is, you can do more! Removing left and right boarders is fantastic to create extra space and use the entire width of a table cell for the content – sometimes rather important for grants!\nYou can do still more. The minimalist Edward Tufte even says ‘every pixel should have a meaning’. In this spirit, removing all gridlines works often just as fine. Often the well-aligned content is sufficient to guide the eye through columns and rows.\n\nVery long tables however are hard to read without any guides. Two options exist. Either, the content may be grouped into blocks of 5 or 10 rows each. The blocks are then visually separated by white space from each other. Alternatively, the table could include a horizontal gridline every 5 or 10 rows.\n\n\n\n\nLast, and only last, think also about color (black and grey are colors too!). I personally like highlighting table headers by giving them a fill color. Usually a light grey works fine, but this very much depends on the overall presentation and the purpose. If shown on a beamer, some light greys don’t work anymore. Also think of color code (and never mix red and green). I consistently used pink, so using the same color for the header would maybe give it a coordinated look. If your fill color is dark, you have to think about white labels. And they in turn requires larger fonts to achieve equal legibility.\n\n\n\n\n\nHeatmap A heatmap is a matrix/table in which the cells are shaded according to a color-scale representing the an observed value. They are particularity used to represent many-to-many comparison. Heatmaps can display very large matrices in at a very small scale and allow us to rapidly compare numbers and even see coherent patterns in the data. Heatmaps may also be combined with clustering algorithms (or simple sorting by value), which facilitates seeing patterns in data. Heatmaps are not useful to get precise numbers.\nMicroarrays A heatmap that informs about gene expression levels across samples. Gene expression is shown as relative expression compared to a ground truth state. Up-regulation is shown in green, downregulation in red (microarrays are thus not color-blind safe).\nHiC plot HiC plots show heat maps where each pixel represents counts for DNA interactions between two genomic regions. The pixel intensity indicates the number of reads (one color scale) or the divergence of reads from a control (dual color scale). The axes each show the genomic regions that are compared, usually binned to e.g. 1Mb.\nDatabase Online formats of tables to present a large dataset.\nTable-Chart hybrid A table with several observations in columns and one of the observations being presented as small chart (dotplot, boxplot, barplot) adjacent to the respective row. The chart-column usually highlights a particularly important observation."

Datasets, data analysis, tools, and presentation is entirely up to the participant. All entries are posted on twitter along with a hashtag for the day, from #Day1 to #Day30. The resulting diversity and personal interpretations are the charm of the challenge and a joy to data scientists and visualizers alike.\n\n\n\n\n    All charts\n\n\n\n\n\nI personally was looking for an excuse to get back to making charts with R. All I could think of at the time was however the war in Ukraine. My granddad Anton Jámbor was born and raised in Khust, Zakarpatia Oblast, which was another reason to finally educate myself about Ukraine. So, I made a plan and almost completed it! I researched the people and population of Ukraine, the country and cities, and a little bit the health data since my day-job is in medical research at the University hospital.\nFrom idea to implementation:\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the course of April I completed 18 of the 30 challenges. Many times I made several solutions and tested many more. Below is the example for Kazimir Malevich. I plotted the color-schemes he used in his paintings over his lifetime and tried our several options, including an animation.\nKazimir Malevich was born in Ukraine and is famous for monochrome,abstract paintings. However, that was a brief period, before and after his paintings are full of colors! I analyzed his color-usage over his lifetime. This was one of the few datasets I created myself.  Malevich’s colors from early to late periods as bar charts\n Malevich’s colors from early to late periods as pie charts\n Malevich’s colors animated\nFinding time each day for a full month was impossible with Easter vacation and care work requiting my attention. Now, in a calm summer, I finally completed five more challenges for which I had already found data. I posted these final entries on Ukraine’s Independence Day, coinciding with 6 months since the war starts.\n\n\n\nMy goal was to create a visually and thematically cohesive work. I plan to use my charts for teaching purposes and for teaching the many ways how we can communicate data with charts. Most of my time, as always, was spend on finding a topic for which a dataset was available. A lot of time was also consumed by data wrangling and getting it in a format to actually make charts. And only a fleeting moment for creating the visualizations. That’s how it goes!\nEnjoy my charts, Slava Ukraini and keep Ukraine in the news!"

    "section": "What we did",
    "text": "What we did\nNot too long ago a motivated group of scientists including me systematically analyzed the clarity and legibility of images (Jambor et al., 2021). It turns out, in only a fraction of the publications, 10-20%, images are fully accessible and interpretable. To get to this number, we surveyed the image quality in the top journals, based on impact factor, in three representative fields, physiology, cell biology and plant sciences. We used a validated protocol and each article was assessed by two independent reviewers. The screening protocol covered diverse aspects: the image presentation in the figure, the completeness of feature annotations, presence of scale information, accessible image colors, and informative image titles/legends.\n\n\n\nSummary of Image Survey, from Jambor et al., 2021)\n\n\n\nScale information: missing in up to 70% of papers\nThis is possibly the most unexpected finding: many images in publications lack sufficient information about physical scales. This is unexpected as each of us had some memories of being taught about scale bars early in our careers, if not already in high-school biology. Scale information can come in many forms and all of them were acceptable to us: as scale bar inside the image, as information about the physical size of the entire image in figures, and even an indication of the magnification were deemed acceptable. This however was entirely missing in 10-30% of the papers and incomplete in another 30-40%.\n\n\n\nMany papers omit scale information for images, from Jambor 2021\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of poor and better scale information, from Jambor 2021\n\n\n\n\nColors: often not accessible to color blind\nRed/Green color blindness affects around 10% of the male population, and less than 1% of the female population. Nonetheless, astonishingly 30 - 50% of the screened images were not color blind friendly! In addition, in around 20% of images the annotations of colors were not color blind save. This means that colorblind readers are hindered in seeing or fully understand the key scientific messages conveyed in these images.\n\n\n\nColors in microscope images and visibility tests from Jambor et al., 2021)\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of color visibility from Jambor et al., 2021)\n\n\n\n\nDetails: not visible, or insets not explained\nJust like in photography, also in microscopy the key subject should ideally fill the frame. What does this mean? If you want to show a cellular detail, do not show the entire petri dish of cells – cutting unnecessary image details is allowed, if this does not change the conclusion! Likewise, if you aim to show morphology of an organ, make sure that said organ is fully visible – image stitching, if declared (legend, methods), is possible and allowed. Many times an overview, e.g. of cell culture dish and a focus on some detail is shown with two images side by side, one the original image and alongside this a zoomed inset. In one third of publications, likely accidental, the origin of the inset in the original image is not clearly indicated or entirely missing. This hinders the audiences to understand the relation of inset to image, especially since in half of the cases the inset is also not explained in the legend.\n\n\n\nInset example and the number of missing inset explanations from Jambor et al., 2021)\n\n\n\n\nAnnotations: incomplete\nSpeaking of annotations – they are not optional, despite what the data suggest: up to 30% of publications omit an explanation of the colors shown in images (e.g., channel, staining), up to 40% fail to explain symbols, regions of interest, or arrows, and many times the species or cell type visible in the image is not clear from the legend. Especially all colors and symbols must essentially be explained with the figure, while further details such as specimen could also be described in the method section – alas, it is also missing very often in this section, but that is another story (Marques G, 2020; Sheen et al., 2019).\n\n\n\nPoor and better annotations, here of the color channels from Jambor et al., 2021)\n\n\n\n\nA happy ending\nWe showed that across all criteria, only 1/5 th of publications with images show fully interpretable images. Beyond our analysis, many papers also fail to understandably present data on image acquisition, imaging methods and also image processing details. We as scientific community have to ensure that our scientific data is truthful and reliable, and also understandable to current and future readers. Incomprehensible images limit effective science communication and we should strive to improve all data we present in publications.\nI have compiled a series of blog posts “How to… Publish Images” that provide a rapid guidance and links to further resources.\n\n\nHow to… image formatting (August 1) Link to blog\n\n\nHow to… image scale information (August 3) Link to blog\n\n\nHow to… image annotation (August 8)Link to blog\n\n\nHow to… image colors (August 10)Link to blog\n\n\nHow to… image availability (August 15)Link to blog\n\n\nHow to… image analysis (tbd)\n\n\nPS if you are interested, I usually write about more general visualizations, e.g., How to create Graphical Abstracts\n\n\nRead more\n\n\nOur article assessing the current quality of images and Recommendations for Creating clear and informative image-based figures for scientific publications.

When doing quantitative comparisons of images, fixed intensity values should be used and novice users should only apply linear adjustments that are applied to the whole image. Important: make these adjustments before cropping an image! Miura and Norrelykke in detail describe how the same adjustment calculation varies when performed on an full-view versus a cropped image. Next, many images are rotated. There are consensus ways to orient images in many fields. Humans are shown with the head at the top and the feet at the bottom, but also other traditions exist, e.g. for epithelia the apical side in shown at the top etc. This often requires rotation of microscope images. All rotations must be done carefully as this process redistributes image intensity values. In most software, increments of 90 degrees pixels can be reordered rather than interpolated, which maintains the intensity distribution. (Find out more here: Miura & Norrelykke 2021, Schmied & Jambor, 2020).\n\n\n\nSequence matters when adjusting brightness contrast. Adapted from Miura & Norrelykke"

Scientist should also consider the size of the image in the final figure: are the features that matter visible? Might it be better to show the image in larger size? Alternatively, consider enlarging and cropping the image to focus the reader on your key result, or ideally show the original image and an image detail (inset) side by side.

In Maria Merian times, size statements were included in the book, not the drawing itself; she usually stated in the preface that all drawings are at real scale.\nMany times familiar objects are included in drawings or images for scale. Often, this is a human figure, e.g. with plants and trees, rocks, or animals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Humans for scale of plants, dinosaurs, and unexpectedly large invertebrates\n\n\nAt times other familiar objects are included: a penny is placed on a rock in geology or a measuring tape is shown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Earth worm next to measuring tape and bone scaled with credit-card measure (merch from Nat_SCA)"

    "text": "Select color display\nThe vast majority of light microscope cameras capture each emission spectrum as a separate greyscale image. Users then often select a display color (‘lookup table’) for each channel. Many times users simply pick the color of the emission wavelengths. DAPI peaks at 461 nm and is then shown in blue, GFP peaks at 509 nm, which is in the green portion of the visible spectrum, and RFP peaks at 583 nm,hence is shown as red.\n\nVisibiilty of colors\nThe problem is that blue or red on the black background of microscopy images have a much lower visibility than the original greyscale image. We can see much more fine details when the signal is shown in white on black, as in the original greyscale image. You thus serve your audiences best if you show microscope images in greyscale also in your figures\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Display colors of light microscope images and a visibility test (greyscale render): details are barely visible in blue on a black background, more structures can be seen when data is shown in white.\n\n\n\n\nAccessibility of colors\nWhen we prepare figures we should also consider color-blind audiences. Problems to differentiate red/green, as is the case in deuteranopia, is well known, but also other combinations may be problematic. Online software and also ImageJ allow you to test color combinations for their visibility to diverse audiences. In general: you may find possibilities to combine two channels in color-blind save mode. It is however impossible to find color options for three or more channels. Thus your safest option is again to show each color channel with a separate greyscale image.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Think of accessibility of your colors and do a visibility test for color combinations."

Among data scientists, it is well established for at least over a century that red and green colors should not be used in parallel when communicating data.\nW.C. Brinton already wrote about this topic in his books in 1914 and 1939 (Chapter 49 “Color and its use”), citing an even older article by Edward Ayers from 1907, that “One man in twenty and one women in about two hundred are unable to see red and green normally” (Brintons book is available online).\nSurprisingly, being considerate with color choices still not reached all: a widely shared technology feature in Nature (Katsnelson, 2021, Colour me better: fixing figures for colour blindness) again calls for authors to use inclusive colors. Also this is echoed by many scientific societies e.g., the American Society for Cell Biology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: WC Brinton published in 1914 his book “Graphic presentation”, which included a guide to which color-combinations and their visibility to normal vision (right column) and color blind (left column) audiences ."

    "text": "More on color combinations\nHow exactly colors can be combined and still be accessible to all readers is controversial. For some images, such as colored photographs, rendering them safe for viewing by colorblind readers is not possible and risks sacrificing clarity. But, as pointed out above, adjusting the display colors is simple for most light microscopy images. Here, colors are selected in the microscope or image processing software. Many already offer combinations of color that are accessible to most colorblind audiences. Currently, many scientists already embraced green/magenta as a color scheme to replace green/red images. However, this may pose a semantic problem, when referring to red-fluorophores depicted in magenta color etc, or a convention problem to others, who feel “Green Fluorescent Protein” should not be shown in e.g., cyan. In light of these semantic and convention obstacles, scientists should embrace publishing each channel of a multicolored light microscope image as a standalone, separate (greyscale) image. Grayscale images are in any case superior to discern fine image details such as specific structures or cells in images. Human eyes perceive the contrast between light and dark areas more easily than they do contrast between a color and dark areas, e.g. as is the case when showing intensities in green on a dark background."

A standard format for loss-loss compression is TIFF or the open format OME-TIFF. In specialized microscopy techniques that rapidly accumulate tera-bites of data, e.g., long-term live-imaging, light-sheet microscopy, or similar the original microscopy files are often not stored locally and too large for public repositories. When only compressed files can be kept, PNG files are preferred to e.g., JPEG files, as they allow loss-less compression.\n\nRead more:\nThe BioImage Archive - Building a Home for Life-Sciences Microscopy Data. 434, 167505.
