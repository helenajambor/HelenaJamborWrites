After my PhD at the EMBL, I worked with multi-dimensional datasets composed of images and genome-scale data at the Max-Planck Dresden. Since my scholarship at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Berlin, I research data visualization in the life science and now combine my expertise with large data sets and my interest in data communication.\nAfter working as a data visualization scientist at the University Hospital Dresden and four years as adjunct professpor for bioinformatics, I am now associate professor for data visualization at the University of Applied Sciences of the Grisons in Chur/Switzerland. I teach, train and consult on data visualization in biology and biomedical research."

    "text": "Last week I visualized the days I did sports in 2017 by hand with illustrator. Most of the time, we want however re-tell similar data (I am not giving up sports anytime soon!), so I always look for ways to create visualizations computationally, for example in R. Therefore, today, I show you how to make a viz of data on days of a year in R.\n\nFirst step: googling (or: duckduck-ing) to find a package other people use for this type of visualization. To my surprise, this took a very long time! Apparently, there is no default package in R that can visualize calendar data!? I found a very laborious solution that someone made with ggplot (referenced here: https://www.r-bloggers.com/ggplot2-time-series-heatmaps/), but it was &gt; 10 lines of code. I then stumbled upon another package, made specifically for visualizing pollutants in air (!), but it works also for other data and is straightforward to use. “openair” takes any dataframe with a “date”-column in the standard format (YYYY-MM-DD) and plots whatever you define as the “pollutant”. In my case, the days I did sports were the “pollutant”.\n3 easy steps:\n\nOpen your data in R, I called my dataframe “sports”.\nThen load library(openair)\nPlot:\n\ncalendarPlot(sports, pollutant = sports, year = 2017)\nVoila!  Red: days I did sports, yellow: lazy days, white: sick days."

    "text": "At some point in her life, a girl’s gotta start with sports to stay healthy and fit when getting older. Did you know that the number of cells in a brain increases when exercising, and that bones stay strong when close to trained muscles (they actually get signaling molecules telling them to stay young!)? My 2017 New year’s resolution was therefore to do sports as often as possible.\nAs I am in love with data, I tracked my progress daily. You can see that I increased from doing sports around 50% of the days to a whopping 90% in July. In January and February, before I was keeping the diary, it was well below half of the days. Clearly, it is easier to run, swim etc. in summer, and I could not keep this up. It was challenging when traveling and on days with a lot of evening appointments and work (November). Most of the days without sports were when I had visitors!\nInitially I also tracked exercise time and what kind of sports I did, but that got too tiring and too complicated. But I did track other parts of my life such as my mood (hint: boring dataset, mainly correlates with female cycle!), my food and my alcohol intake. Interestingly, there is no correlation between sports and alcohol. I do not drink on those days that I feel too miserable for sports. Some days I drank a sip (light grey, a small sherry or so) after my sports, some days I neither drank nor did sports.\nSince I use my diary regularly, I of course tracked all this data on paper: \nI thought a lot about how to present it best, and at the end of the day, I really wanted to showcase my daily routine – this is why the final visualization does not look very different. I only added a bar chart summarizing the data.\nI started out making a dot for each day in a simple table format: \nThen I adjusted the number of days and numbered them to have a week-like format. Sticking to standard practice: labeling 1, 8, 15 is of course counter-intuitive, so I quickly changed this to 7/14/21.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nI then added the actual data: empty space for days without sports, a circle for days I did sports, and a cross for sick days.  Having completed the data visualization, I then started the graphic design part – decluttering wherever possible, playing with color and adjusting layout If necessary. For example, the table like boxes were not necessary at all. What about the lines separating weeks? They are ugly, even in grey!, but some guide is needed to wade through the days. The Gestalt principles show that white space is more effective in grouping that lines and boxes. To discriminate between ‘no sports’ and white space, I changed the white data points to a light grey.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nAll right, looking better! Now some more details… I added a summarizing bar chart of the percentage of days I did sports (not counting sick days), added titles, axis labels, tick marks, and I also showed the data for the months in which I tracked my alcohol consumption. \nAt last – and always at last only! – I added color, and I am in love with blue."

    "title": "How to… Tables",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Tables are one of the most successful visualizations in the history of science. They existed long before charts were invented. Friedrich Miescher reported the discovery of nucleic acids in a small table with just three rows. Janni Nusslein-Volhardt and Eric Wieschaus compiled their observations that gene expression controls embryogenesis in a table. And the seminal discovery that cells are enclosed by a lipid bilayer warranted a full-page table: Today, tables are still common in scientific papers and presentations today. I just counted around that 14 articles in a recent issue of nature had some kind of table. Simple tables are often relegated to the supplemental section. In the main section, tables come in fancier formats and disguise as heatmaps, HiC plots, or databases.\n\n \n\n\n\n\nWhen a figure is done well, it provides us instant insight to the main message and visually guides us with thick lines, tall bars, patterns in a scatter plot etc to the key data. Tables on the other hand just show text and numbers in an organized form. When reading a table, we use it as text; we read from top left, to bottom right. And this is the intention of a table: it presents a complete dataset without a punchy, key message. Tables force the reader to come up with their own conclusion based on the entire data points. This means they need quite a bit of space and are more work to our audiences.\nDespite its disadvantages, a table is very useful for reporting precise numbers, and for in detail comparisons. Tables are also great for presenting large datasets, in which every member of our audience is interested in a different aspect of the data. For example, each reader of the table below (ERC starting grants per country) will look for their country of interest first. If however you have a clear message, e.g., show which country gets most ERCs, use a bar chart (sort bars by size!), or when you show statistical summaries pick one of  the many chart types for this purpose.\n\n\n\n\nBecause tables are organized text, alignment and typography are critical for their legibility, and good legibility allows faster reading.\n\n\nWhich data is used as the key for presenting the result? This goes to the first column of every row. In our case these are the country names. All observations for this country, ERC grants, population, funding rate, get a column each.\n\n\n\nText is best left aligned, where we start reading text. Numbers are right aligned to make comparisons by digits along a column easier. Note: each column header is aligned with its content. That means the header for a text column is left aligned, the header for a number column right aligned.\n\n\n\n\nChoosing a legible font is always great, but really critical for numbers. To be legible, all numbers should have the same height (“new style”) and the same width (“tabular/monospace”). The width is important to compare digits within columns, the same height (so no ascenders and descenders in numbers) looks overall less cluttered.\nIt is not possible to make easy recommendation for a specific font since they are modified depending on the operating system and program. For example, Arial has proportional characters which would not work for numbers in a table. Microsoft Word/Mac has adapted the numbers to be tabularized, while Adobe illustrator/Mac has not.\n\n\n\n\nTo best compare numbers in a column, they should have the same decimal points. This helps the alignment and the understanding. In general, it is always worth considering if the decimals are even important: number of grants does not warrant a decimal because it can only be a whole number. Same for humans, but humans in millions might be reasonably presented with one decimal.\n\n\n\n\nWith the above rules, you usually end up with an organized and legible table. But good news is, you can do more! Removing left and right boarders is fantastic to create extra space and use the entire width of a table cell for the content – sometimes rather important for grants!\nYou can do still more. The minimalist Edward Tufte even says ‘every pixel should have a meaning’. In this spirit, removing all gridlines works often just as fine. Often the well-aligned content is sufficient to guide the eye through columns and rows.\n\nVery long tables however are hard to read without any guides. Two options exist. Either, the content may be grouped into blocks of 5 or 10 rows each. The blocks are then visually separated by white space from each other. Alternatively, the table could include a horizontal gridline every 5 or 10 rows.\n\n\n\n\nLast, and only last, think also about color (black and grey are colors too!). I personally like highlighting table headers by giving them a fill color. Usually a light grey works fine, but this very much depends on the overall presentation and the purpose. If shown on a beamer, some light greys don’t work anymore. Also think of color code (and never mix red and green). I consistently used pink, so using the same color for the header would maybe give it a coordinated look. If your fill color is dark, you have to think about white labels. And they in turn requires larger fonts to achieve equal legibility.\n\n\n\n\n\nHeatmap A heatmap is a matrix/table in which the cells are shaded according to a color-scale representing the an observed value. They are particularity used to represent many-to-many comparison. Heatmaps can display very large matrices in at a very small scale and allow us to rapidly compare numbers and even see coherent patterns in the data. Heatmaps may also be combined with clustering algorithms (or simple sorting by value), which facilitates seeing patterns in data. Heatmaps are not useful to get precise numbers.\nMicroarrays A heatmap that informs about gene expression levels across samples. Gene expression is shown as relative expression compared to a ground truth state. Up-regulation is shown in green, downregulation in red (microarrays are thus not color-blind safe).\nHiC plot HiC plots show heat maps where each pixel represents counts for DNA interactions between two genomic regions. The pixel intensity indicates the number of reads (one color scale) or the divergence of reads from a control (dual color scale). The axes each show the genomic regions that are compared, usually binned to e.g. 1Mb.\nDatabase Online formats of tables to present a large dataset.\nTable-Chart hybrid A table with several observations in columns and one of the observations being presented as small chart (dotplot, boxplot, barplot) adjacent to the respective row. The chart-column usually highlights a particularly important observation."

Datasets, data analysis, tools, and presentation is entirely up to the participant. All entries are posted on twitter along with a hashtag for the day, from #Day1 to #Day30. The resulting diversity and personal interpretations are the charm of the challenge and a joy to data scientists and visualizers alike.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    All charts\n\n\n\n\n\nI personally was looking for an excuse to get back to making charts with R. All I could think of at the time was however the war in Ukraine. My granddad Anton Jámbor was born and raised in Khust, Zakarpatia Oblast, which was another reason to finally educate myself about Ukraine. So, I made a plan and almost completed it! I researched the people and population of Ukraine, the country and cities, and a little bit the health data since my day-job is in medical research at the University hospital.\nFrom idea to implementation:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the course of April I completed 18 of the 30 challenges. Many times I made several solutions and tested many more. Below is the example for Kazimir Malevich. I plotted the color-schemes he used in his paintings over his lifetime and tried our several options, including an animation.\nKazimir Malevich was born in Ukraine and is famous for monochrome,abstract paintings. However, that was a brief period, before and after his paintings are full of colors! I analyzed his color-usage over his lifetime. This was one of the few datasets I created myself.  Malevich’s colors from early to late periods as bar charts\n Malevich’s colors from early to late periods as pie charts\n Malevich’s colors animated\nFinding time each day for a full month was impossible with Easter vacation and care work requiting my attention. Now, in a calm summer, I finally completed five more challenges for which I had already found data. I posted these final entries on Ukraine’s Independence Day, coinciding with 6 months since the war starts.\n\n\n\nMy goal was to create a visually and thematically cohesive work. I plan to use my charts for teaching purposes and for teaching the many ways how we can communicate data with charts. Most of my time, as always, was spend on finding a topic for which a dataset was available. A lot of time was also consumed by data wrangling and getting it in a format to actually make charts. And only a fleeting moment for creating the visualizations. That’s how it goes!\nEnjoy my charts, Slava Ukraini and keep Ukraine in the news!"

    "text": "Graphical abstracts are increasingly common to explain biomedical concepts and research results. As “summary slides”, they have long been used at the end of a talk or lecture. Today, graphical abstracts are widely used as a thumbnail/preview of online publications and also found at posters, on lab websites, and in research grant applications. The key element of every graphical abstract are the visuals - pictograms, icons, or images. Text, arrows and lines then combine the visual elements into a narrated story, and color highlights key elements or encodes quantities. I summarized a few key points to consider before designing a graphical abstract.\n\n\n\nExample Graphical abstracts for a paper (left) and a grant (right). Left from: Saenz lab \n\n\n\n\nAll graphical abstract have key visuals and usually these are icons, pictograms or symbols, less common are iconic microscope or photographic pics or charts. Pictograms can be illustrations, constructed from simple shapes, but mostly are found in icon libraries. Many icon libraries are free and some can also be used without attribution (public domain). In libraries, icons can be downloaded as PNG or SVG file. PNG, Portable Network Graphic, is a raster-graphics format for lossless data compression. PNGs are ready to use on the web or in software, but are not adaptable.

Very neat, you can request support and icons!\nReactome started a collection of scientific pictograms and chemical drawings for free re-use and encourages the upload of user-designed pictograms for sharing with the scientific community. I have not seen it grow much, wonder where it will go.\n\nWhen selecting icons for a graphical abstract make sure all icons have an overall similar appearance: same line-width, colors, and level of detail. Many times icon libraries have a design team to ensure this, but open libraries collect pictograms from various designers with quite distinct appearance. When you want to adapt icons to match in style, get the SVG file which is adaptable with e.g., Inkscape or Illustrator.\n\n\n\nWhat not to do: icons are not matched in style\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to do: mix icons that have overall similar appearance\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen a key visual should show data in the form of a chart, it is advisable to stick to the most common chart types, bar, line, pie chart or scatter plots. Most readers are familiar with these and they are founded on our core visual perception abilities, comparing lengths, angles, or slopes. For all charts ensure that only a few categories or data points are included and details, tick marks, axis label, legends, are omitted.\n\n\n\nSimple Charts that may be used in Graphical Abstracts\n\n\nComplex charts should only be used if they have e.g. iconic status to indicate a specific method was used: in life sciences t-SNE often symbolize single cell data was obtained, and red/green heatmaps indicate microarray data.\nA good overview of chart types and their use is summarized in data viz catalogues (e.g., The Data Visualisation Catalogue)\n\n\n\nGraphical abstracts can be prepared with the same software also used for posters and figures. Many of you will use PoswerPoint. Suitable vector-design software are:\n\nAdobe Illustrator (commercial)\nCorelDraw (commercial)\nAffinity Designer (commercial)\nopen-source: Inkscape - this sweet readers, has direct link to many icon libraries (newest version)! Go to File &gt; Import Web Image &gt; select library.\n\nVector-based graphics programs allow zooming in and out without quality loss. For most graphical abstracts PowerPoint will also produce sufficient results when slides are adjusted in size and exported as vector graphics, e.g., as PDF. To prevent pixelation select that images are not compressed in the options. A big plus of the open source Inkscape: it keeps getting better. Newest feature: direct import of icons from web-based icon libraries via “Import Web Image” tab. This works already for Bioicons and Reactome via dropdown. Also possible in Inkscaoe: script-based image processing, and script-based chart preparation. Another plus, Inkscape relies on the web vector format SVG and is thus readable by browsers and other vector graphics programs.\n\n\n\nA popular, however increasingly costly option are Biorender and MindtheGraph, that have annual subscription plans. Biorender has many sample templates for a quick start and vast icons for life sciences, but you must regularly check the licenses as they are constantly adapted.

Did you know that the number of cells in a brain increases when exercising, and that bones stay strong when close to trained muscles (they actually get signaling molecules telling them to stay young!)? My 2017 New year’s resolution was therefore to do sports as often as possible.\nAs I am in love with data, I tracked my progress daily. You can see that I increased from doing sports around 50% of the days to a whopping 90% in July. In January and February, before I was keeping the diary, it was well below half of the days.

    "section": "",
    "text": "In Graphical Abstracts 1 I outlined where you can find tools, icons, pictograms and simple charts for you Graphical Abstracts. In the next step, the visuals need to be organised into a logical sequence. You therefore need to know your page dimension, decide on a reading direction, and then support the chosen layout with arrows. And at the very end, you can add a little text and colors Graphical Abstracts 3\n\n\nLayout is defined as the arrangement of parts on an area. What area can you fill? Many times journals request Graphical Abstracts as squares as they are used as thumbnail preview for your article. See for example the landing page of Current Biology: \nNote that the image is roughly stamp-size and that the best graphical abstracts should work in this size. When your graphical abstract is a full figure for a paper, poster, or grant, you usually aim for a rectangle-landscape area: this fits much better onto a page and it is also easier to design a reading direction for rectangles. Especially when your space is limited, such as in grant application,s make use of the full-line width to not waste any precious space!\n\n\n\nHow much space can you fill? The page size determines layout choices\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen designing a graphical abstract you have to clearly tell your audiences where they should start reading. We read text and also all visuals from left to right, unless prompted otherwise by color, arreows, size of image etc.\nWhich reading direction you chose depends on your message: if you talk about a linear processes with clear beginning and end, an organization from left to right is suitable as time is usually shown this way (e.g., as x-axis in line charts). Linear processes could be workflows or experimental pipelines, but also cellular processes such as embryo development, cell differentiation, or disease progression. If you instead talk about cyclic events, such as daily or annual recurrences, metabolic cycles, or also cell division, consider using a circular layout. If you just want to make a comparison, before after, on or off, scenario and Zoomed in view, etc, consider a parallel or nested organization.\n\n\n\nThe most common organizational layouts of graphical abstracts, adapted from  Hullman and Bach 2018\n\n\nMore about arranging visual elements and reading direction also check out the Nature Methods Point of View article by Bang Wong.\n\n\n\nArrows are omnipresent in all explanatory figures. They connect text, pictograms, images, or charts into a sequential narrative or “storyline”. Arrows come in many designs, just arrowheads, lines with a rounded tip or numerous other end-marks, and of course also lines without any marks can be used to guide the view. Depending on the arrow design, it can adopt many different functions: arrows can simply reinforce the layout, or they can highlight an exception from a reading direction. But arrows can also point to strucures or regions, label, indicate movement, or time. An upward arrow for example could mean ‘move up’, ‘increase’ or ‘good’, while a circular arrow could be day, year or life cycle. In addition, many many domains specific meanings exist, e.g. a cornered arrow for transcription start sites in molecular genetics. Importantly, the semantic meaning of an arrow is highly depended on the context in which it is presented. In graphical abstracts we should decide on one meaning for our arrows, and refrain from varying this.

    "text": "How to… Graphical Abstacts 2\nIn Graphical Abstracts 1 I outlined where you can find tools, icons, pictograms and simple charts for you Graphical Abstracts. In the next step, the visuals need to be organised into a logical sequence. You therefore need to know your page dimension, decide on a reading direction, and then support the chosen layout with arrows. And at the very end, you can add a little text and colors Graphical Abstracts 3\n\nPage dimension\nLayout is defined as the arrangement of parts on an area. What area can you fill? Many times journals request Graphical Abstracts as squares as they are used as thumbnail preview for your article. See for example the landing page of Current Biology: \nNote that the image is roughly stamp-size and that the best graphical abstracts should work in this size. When your graphical abstract is a full figure for a paper, poster, or grant, you usually aim for a rectangle-landscape area: this fits much better onto a page and it is also easier to design a reading direction for rectangles. Especially when your space is limited, such as in grant application,s make use of the full-line width to not waste any precious space!\n\n\n\nHow much space can you fill? The page size determines layout choices\n\n\n\n\nReading direction\nWhen designing a graphical abstract you have to clearly tell your audiences where they should start reading. We read text and also all visuals from left to right, unless prompted otherwise by color, arreows, size of image etc.\nWhich reading direction you chose depends on your message: if you talk about a linear processes with clear beginning and end, an organization from left to right is suitable as time is usually shown this way (e.g., as x-axis in line charts). Linear processes could be workflows or experimental pipelines, but also cellular processes such as embryo development, cell differentiation, or disease progression. If you instead talk about cyclic events, such as daily or annual recurrences, metabolic cycles, or also cell division, consider using a circular layout. If you just want to make a comparison, before after, on or off, scenario and Zoomed in view, etc, consider a parallel or nested organization.\n\n\n\nThe most common organizational layouts of graphical abstracts, adapted from  Hullman and Bach 2018\n\n\nMore about arranging visual elements and reading direction also check out the Nature Methods Point of View article by Bang Wong.\n\n\nArrows connect the visuals\nArrows are omnipresent in all explanatory figures. They connect text, pictograms, images, or charts into a sequential narrative or “storyline”. Arrows come in many designs, just arrowheads, lines with a rounded tip or numerous other end-marks, and of course also lines without any marks can be used to guide the view. Depending on the arrow design, it can adopt many different functions: arrows can simply reinforce the layout, or they can highlight an exception from a reading direction. But arrows can also point to strucures or regions, label, indicate movement, or time. An upward arrow for example could mean ‘move up’, ‘increase’ or ‘good’, while a circular arrow could be day, year or life cycle. In addition, many many domains specific meanings exist, e.g. a cornered arrow for transcription start sites in molecular genetics. Importantly, the semantic meaning of an arrow is highly depended on the context in which it is presented. In graphical abstracts we should decide on one meaning for our arrows, and refrain from varying this. When two arrow types are combined in one graphical abstract thy should be visually cleraly distinct and may have to be explicit explained to readers.\n\n\n\nArrow and their meanings\n\n\nMore about arrows: The seminal work about semantic meanings of arrows by Barbara Tversky: Tversky, B., Zacks, J., Lee, P., Heiser, J., 2000.

    "title": "How to… Tables",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Tables are one of the most successful visualizations in the history of science. They existed long before charts were invented. Friedrich Miescher reported the discovery of nucleic acids in a small table with just three rows. Janni Nusslein-Volhardt and Eric Wieschaus compiled their observations that gene expression controls embryogenesis in a table. And the seminal discovery that cells are enclosed by a lipid bilayer warranted a full-page table: Today, tables are still common in scientific papers and presentations today. I just counted around that 14 articles in a recent issue of nature had some kind of table. Simple tables are often relegated to the supplemental section. In the main section, tables come in fancier formats and disguise as heatmaps, HiC plots, or databases.\n\n \n\n\n\n\nWhen a figure is done well, it provides us instant insight to the main message and visually guides us with thick lines, tall bars, patterns in a scatter plot etc to the key data. Tables on the other hand just show text and numbers in an organized form. When reading a table, we use it as text; we read from top left, to bottom right. And this is the intention of a table: it presents a complete dataset without a punchy, key message. Tables force the reader to come up with their own conclusion based on the entire data points. This means they need quite a bit of space and are more work to our audiences.\nDespite its disadvantages, a table is very useful for reporting precise numbers, and for in detail comparisons. Tables are also great for presenting large datasets, in which every member of our audience is interested in a different aspect of the data. For example, each reader of the table below (ERC starting grants per country) will look for their country of interest first. If however you have a clear message, e.g., show which country gets most ERCs, use a bar chart (sort bars by size!), or when you show statistical summaries pick one of  the many chart types for this purpose.\n\n\n\n\nBecause tables are organized text, alignment and typography are critical for their legibility, and good legibility allows faster reading.\n\n\nWhich data is used as the key for presenting the result? This goes to the first column of every row. In our case these are the country names. All observations for this country, ERC grants, population, funding rate, get a column each.\n\n\n\nText is best left aligned, where we start reading text. Numbers are right aligned to make comparisons by digits along a column easier. Note: each column header is aligned with its content. That means the header for a text column is left aligned, the header for a number column right aligned.\n\n\n\n\nChoosing a legible font is always great, but really critical for numbers. To be legible, all numbers should have the same height (“new style”) and the same width (“tabular/monospace”). The width is important to compare digits within columns, the same height (so no ascenders and descenders in numbers) looks overall less cluttered.\nIt is not possible to make easy recommendation for a specific font since they are modified depending on the operating system and program. For example, Arial has proportional characters which would not work for numbers in a table. Microsoft Word/Mac has adapted the numbers to be tabularized, while Adobe illustrator/Mac has not.\n\n\n\n\nTo best compare numbers in a column, they should have the same decimal points. This helps the alignment and the understanding. In general, it is always worth considering if the decimals are even important: number of grants does not warrant a decimal because it can only be a whole number. Same for humans, but humans in millions might be reasonably presented with one decimal.\n\n\n\n\nWith the above rules, you usually end up with an organized and legible table. But good news is, you can do more! Removing left and right boarders is fantastic to create extra space and use the entire width of a table cell for the content – sometimes rather important for grants!\nYou can do still more. The minimalist Edward Tufte even says ‘every pixel should have a meaning’. In this spirit, removing all gridlines works often just as fine. Often the well-aligned content is sufficient to guide the eye through columns and rows.\n\nVery long tables however are hard to read without any guides. Two options exist. Either, the content may be grouped into blocks of 5 or 10 rows each. The blocks are then visually separated by white space from each other. Alternatively, the table could include a horizontal gridline every 5 or 10 rows.\n\n\n\n\nLast, and only last, think also about color (black and grey are colors too!). I personally like highlighting table headers by giving them a fill color. Usually a light grey works fine, but this very much depends on the overall presentation and the purpose. If shown on a beamer, some light greys don’t work anymore. Also think of color code (and never mix red and green). I consistently used pink, so using the same color for the header would maybe give it a coordinated look. If your fill color is dark, you have to think about white labels. And they in turn requires larger fonts to achieve equal legibility.\n\n\n\n\n\nHeatmap A heatmap is a matrix/table in which the cells are shaded according to a color-scale representing the an observed value. They are particularity used to represent many-to-many comparison. Heatmaps can display very large matrices in at a very small scale and allow us to rapidly compare numbers and even see coherent patterns in the data. Heatmaps may also be combined with clustering algorithms (or simple sorting by value), which facilitates seeing patterns in data. Heatmaps are not useful to get precise numbers.\nMicroarrays A heatmap that informs about gene expression levels across samples. Gene expression is shown as relative expression compared to a ground truth state. Up-regulation is shown in green, downregulation in red (microarrays are thus not color-blind safe).\nHiC plot HiC plots show heat maps where each pixel represents counts for DNA interactions between two genomic regions. The pixel intensity indicates the number of reads (one color scale) or the divergence of reads from a control (dual color scale). The axes each show the genomic regions that are compared, usually binned to e.g. 1Mb.\nDatabase Online formats of tables to present a large dataset.\nTable-Chart hybrid A table with several observations in columns and one of the observations being presented as small chart (dotplot, boxplot, barplot) adjacent to the respective row. The chart-column usually highlights a particularly important observation."

Datasets, data analysis, tools, and presentation is entirely up to the participant. All entries are posted on twitter along with a hashtag for the day, from #Day1 to #Day30. The resulting diversity and personal interpretations are the charm of the challenge and a joy to data scientists and visualizers alike.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    All charts\n\n\n\n\n\nI personally was looking for an excuse to get back to making charts with R. All I could think of at the time was however the war in Ukraine. My granddad Anton Jámbor was born and raised in Khust, Zakarpatia Oblast, which was another reason to finally educate myself about Ukraine. So, I made a plan and almost completed it! I researched the people and population of Ukraine, the country and cities, and a little bit the health data since my day-job is in medical research at the University hospital.\nFrom idea to implementation:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the course of April I completed 18 of the 30 challenges. Many times I made several solutions and tested many more. Below is the example for Kazimir Malevich. I plotted the color-schemes he used in his paintings over his lifetime and tried our several options, including an animation.\nKazimir Malevich was born in Ukraine and is famous for monochrome,abstract paintings. However, that was a brief period, before and after his paintings are full of colors! I analyzed his color-usage over his lifetime. This was one of the few datasets I created myself.  Malevich’s colors from early to late periods as bar charts\n Malevich’s colors from early to late periods as pie charts\n Malevich’s colors animated\nFinding time each day for a full month was impossible with Easter vacation and care work requiting my attention. Now, in a calm summer, I finally completed five more challenges for which I had already found data. I posted these final entries on Ukraine’s Independence Day, coinciding with 6 months since the war starts.\n\n\n\nMy goal was to create a visually and thematically cohesive work. I plan to use my charts for teaching purposes and for teaching the many ways how we can communicate data with charts. Most of my time, as always, was spend on finding a topic for which a dataset was available. A lot of time was also consumed by data wrangling and getting it in a format to actually make charts. And only a fleeting moment for creating the visualizations. That’s how it goes!\nEnjoy my charts, Slava Ukraini and keep Ukraine in the news!"

    "section": "What we did",
    "text": "What we did\nNot too long ago a motivated group of scientists including me systematically analyzed the clarity and legibility of images (Jambor et al., 2021). It turns out, in only a fraction of the publications, 10-20%, images are fully accessible and interpretable. To get to this number, we surveyed the image quality in the top journals, based on impact factor, in three representative fields, physiology, cell biology and plant sciences. We used a validated protocol and each article was assessed by two independent reviewers. The screening protocol covered diverse aspects: the image presentation in the figure, the completeness of feature annotations, presence of scale information, accessible image colors, and informative image titles/legends.\n\n\n\nSummary of Image Survey, from Jambor et al., 2021)\n\n\n\nScale information: missing in up to 70% of papers\nThis is possibly the most unexpected finding: many images in publications lack sufficient information about physical scales. This is unexpected as each of us had some memories of being taught about scale bars early in our careers, if not already in high-school biology. Scale information can come in many forms and all of them were acceptable to us: as scale bar inside the image, as information about the physical size of the entire image in figures, and even an indication of the magnification were deemed acceptable. This however was entirely missing in 10-30% of the papers and incomplete in another 30-40%.\n\n\n\nMany papers omit scale information for images, from Jambor 2021\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of poor and better scale information, from Jambor 2021\n\n\n\n\nColors: often not accessible to color blind\nRed/Green color blindness affects around 10% of the male population, and less than 1% of the female population. Nonetheless, astonishingly 30 - 50% of the screened images were not color blind friendly! In addition, in around 20% of images the annotations of colors were not color blind save. This means that colorblind readers are hindered in seeing or fully understand the key scientific messages conveyed in these images.\n\n\n\nColors in microscope images and visibility tests from Jambor et al., 2021)\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of color visibility from Jambor et al., 2021)\n\n\n\n\nDetails: not visible, or insets not explained\nJust like in photography, also in microscopy the key subject should ideally fill the frame. What does this mean? If you want to show a cellular detail, do not show the entire petri dish of cells – cutting unnecessary image details is allowed, if this does not change the conclusion! Likewise, if you aim to show morphology of an organ, make sure that said organ is fully visible – image stitching, if declared (legend, methods), is possible and allowed. Many times an overview, e.g. of cell culture dish and a focus on some detail is shown with two images side by side, one the original image and alongside this a zoomed inset. In one third of publications, likely accidental, the origin of the inset in the original image is not clearly indicated or entirely missing. This hinders the audiences to understand the relation of inset to image, especially since in half of the cases the inset is also not explained in the legend.\n\n\n\nInset example and the number of missing inset explanations from Jambor et al., 2021)\n\n\n\n\nAnnotations: incomplete\nSpeaking of annotations – they are not optional, despite what the data suggest: up to 30% of publications omit an explanation of the colors shown in images (e.g., channel, staining), up to 40% fail to explain symbols, regions of interest, or arrows, and many times the species or cell type visible in the image is not clear from the legend. Especially all colors and symbols must essentially be explained with the figure, while further details such as specimen could also be described in the method section – alas, it is also missing very often in this section, but that is another story (Marques G, 2020; Sheen et al., 2019).\n\n\n\nPoor and better annotations, here of the color channels from Jambor et al., 2021)\n\n\n\n\nA happy ending\nWe showed that across all criteria, only 1/5 th of publications with images show fully interpretable images. Beyond our analysis, many papers also fail to understandably present data on image acquisition, imaging methods and also image processing details. We as scientific community have to ensure that our scientific data is truthful and reliable, and also understandable to current and future readers. Incomprehensible images limit effective science communication and we should strive to improve all data we present in publications.\nI have compiled a series of blog posts “How to… Publish Images” that provide a rapid guidance and links to further resources.\n\n\nHow to… image formatting (August 1) Link to blog\n\n\nHow to… image scale information (August 3) Link to blog\n\n\nHow to… image annotation (August 8) Link to blog\n\n\nHow to… image colors (August 10) Link to blog\n\n\nHow to… image availability (August 15) Link to blog\n\n\nCheat sheets for image publishing (August 21) Link to blog\n\n\nA short history of science images (August 27) Link to blog\n\n\nHow to… image analysis (Sept 20) Link to blog\n\n\nHow to… avoid misleading with images (Sept 22) Link to blog\n\n\nPS if you are interested, I usually write about more general visualizations, e.g., How to create Graphical Abstracts\n\n\nRead more\n\n\nOur article assessing the current quality of images and Recommendations for Creating clear and informative image-based figures for scientific publications.

    "text": "Adjust brighness and orientation\nAlmost always adjustments are necessary in digital images, most common of the brightness and contrast. When doing quantitative comparisons of images, fixed intensity values should be used and novice users should only apply linear adjustments that are applied to the whole image. Important: make these adjustments before cropping an image! Miura and Norrelykke in detail describe how the same adjustment calculation varies when performed on an full-view versus a cropped image. Next, many images are rotated. There are consensus ways to orient images in many fields. Humans are shown with the head at the top and the feet at the bottom, but also other traditions exist, e.g. for epithelia the apical side in shown at the top etc. This often requires rotation of microscope images. All rotations must be done carefully as this process redistributes image intensity values. In most software, increments of 90 degrees pixels can be reordered rather than interpolated, which maintains the intensity distribution. (Find out more here: Miura & Norrelykke 2021, Schmied & Jambor, 2020).\n\n\n\nSequence matters when adjusting brightness contrast. Adapted from Miura & Norrelykke"

    "text": "Cropping & Magnification\nCropping is a normal adjustment to focus the audience on the key message. To show cellular structures, a close up of the organelle is required, not the whole slide that was imaged. As a rule, cropping is permitted, as long as no key feature is removed that is important for the scientific conclusion. Scientist should also consider the size of the image in the final figure: are the features that matter visible? Might it be better to show the image in larger size? Alternatively, consider enlarging and cropping the image to focus the reader on your key result, or ideally show the original image and an image detail (inset) side by side. When insets are shown their position in the original image must be indicated, e.g., with a “Region of interest”.\n\n\n\nExample of poor and improved insets in figuresfrom Jambor 2021"

DAPI peaks at 461 nm and is then shown in blue, GFP peaks at 509 nm, which is in the green portion of the visible spectrum, and RFP peaks at 583 nm,hence is shown as red.\n\nVisibiilty of colors\nThe problem is that blue or red on the black background of microscopy images have a much lower visibility than the original greyscale image. We can see much more fine details when the signal is shown in white on black, as in the original greyscale image. You thus serve your audiences best if you show microscope images in greyscale also in your figures\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Display colors of light microscope images and a visibility test (greyscale render): details are barely visible in blue on a black background, more structures can be seen when data is shown in white.\n\n\n\n\nAccessibility of colors\nWhen we prepare figures we should also consider color-blind audiences. Problems to differentiate red/green, as is the case in deuteranopia, is well known, but also other combinations may be problematic. Online software and also ImageJ allow you to test color combinations for their visibility to diverse audiences. In general: you may find possibilities to combine two channels in color-blind save mode. It is however impossible to find color options for three or more channels. Thus your safest option is again to show each color channel with a separate greyscale image.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Think of accessibility of your colors and do a visibility test for color combinations."

Among data scientists, it is well established for at least over a century that red and green colors should not be used in parallel when communicating data.\nW.C. Brinton already wrote about this topic in his books in 1914 and 1939 (Chapter 49 “Color and its use”), citing an even older article by Edward Ayers from 1907, that “One man in twenty and one women in about two hundred are unable to see red and green normally” (Brintons book is available online).\nSurprisingly, being considerate with color choices still not reached all: a widely shared technology feature in Nature (Katsnelson, 2021, Colour me better: fixing figures for colour blindness) again calls for authors to use inclusive colors. Also this is echoed by many scientific societies e.g., the American Society for Cell Biology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: WC Brinton published in 1914 his book “Graphic presentation”, which included a guide to which color-combinations and their visibility to normal vision (right column) and color blind (left column) audiences ."

    "text": "More on color combinations\nHow exactly colors can be combined and still be accessible to all readers is controversial. For some images, such as colored photographs, rendering them safe for viewing by colorblind readers is not possible and risks sacrificing clarity. But, as pointed out above, adjusting the display colors is simple for most light microscopy images. Here, colors are selected in the microscope or image processing software. Many already offer combinations of color that are accessible to most colorblind audiences. Currently, many scientists already embraced green/magenta as a color scheme to replace green/red images. However, this may pose a semantic problem, when referring to red-fluorophores depicted in magenta color etc, or a convention problem to others, who feel “Green Fluorescent Protein” should not be shown in e.g., cyan. In light of these semantic and convention obstacles, scientists should embrace publishing each channel of a multicolored light microscope image as a standalone, separate (greyscale) image. Grayscale images are in any case superior to discern fine image details such as specific structures or cells in images. Human eyes perceive the contrast between light and dark areas more easily than they do contrast between a color and dark areas, e.g. as is the case when showing intensities in green on a dark background."

    "text": "Photography\nWith the advent of photography, publications started to include photos and microscopic images of specimen. A pioneer of photographic images in biology and medicine was the physiologist Marey. Étienne-Jules Marey, a French physiologist, developed many medical apparatuses, and notably the first “chronophotographic gun” in 1882 which allowed him to capture twelve frames per second on the same picture to document the rapid movements of animal and human locomotion. Notably, Marey also authored the first text book of data visualizing for physiology, introducing many scientists to charts and how to use photo images as evidence in biomedicine. The book, La Méthode graphique dans les sciences expérimentales can be viewed online in French (Text on line) and was recently translated by George Hattab and RJ Andrews.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Marey invented a method to study locomotion with photography\n\n\nAt the turn of the last century, the first photographs appeared in scientific journals and slowly photos were used to document biological observations made through the microscope, e.g. Newth’s microscopic image of lamprey’s larvae. At the same time, Friedrich Kopsch in Berlin captured serial time-lapse images to document gastrulation in axolotl and frog eggs.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Photo by Newth in Nature, July, 1930 documents feeding of an Amphioxus larva\n\n\nImage in scientific publications however were not always well received – in a letter to the editor, Benjamin Moore complained in 1910 that:\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Letter to the Editor, Nature\n\n\nThe invention of fluorescent markers and techniques to couple these to antibodies by Albert Coons made light microscopy a mainstream technique widely accepted and images became accepted as data also outside its core application fields, embryology and morphology. With the invention of photography, and in particular digital photo-micrography, a steady increase in images figures is noticeable in scientific articles. Today 20% of the articles indexed in PubMed contain image figures and in the minutes you spend reading this article, 5 new publications with images will appear.\n\n\n\nFigure 5: One of the first videos with a fluorescent microscope, published by Horio and Hotani 1986\n\n\n\nMore literature on scientific images\n\n\nA seminal book that describes how images became data in science: Daston L, & Peter Galison, P. .

I ended up chatting with Rita Strack, editor at Nature Methods about journal strategies to ensure image figures are legible (none back then!) and my idea for a survey. The idea evolved into a project when I teamed up with Tracey Weissgerber in the eLIFE ambassador programme. Tracey had experience with meta-research (i.e. screening literature) and with out group we analyzed published images with a standardized protocol. Now we had numbers for what previously was just an impression: lots of pictures didn’t have sizes marks, giving readers a little guessing game time. The colors? Turns out, many were like secret codes that only the authors could understand. Plus, the explanations often barely enlightened - check ourpaper in PLOS BIO\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Summary of the PLOS BIO numbers we collected."

The Q&A was a lively discussion of many impossible ways to improve image communication and one clear idea: let’s form a QUAREP working group for this! Starting with just four members, we hashed, clashed, and conjured what eventually became the checklists for image publishing. Quickly our Working Group 12 grew and became very interdisciplinary: we have members from research institutes, medical clinics, and even NASA; from all continents and time-zones; from applied research, companies and theory. Safe to say, we also at times failed to find a consensus and tip toed around some topics until we dropped them. Our opinions also differed on how strict we wanted to be with guidelines but also there found a workable compromise between our ideals and reality. In the end, all scientists globally, also those with little access to advanced microscopy facilities, should be empowered to reach the minimal goals, while at the same time we also wanted to push some higher image and image analysis standards. This lead to the the three levels, mandatory, recommended and ideal.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Evolution of the checklists. From white-silver-gold to Recommended and Ideal.

Turning to the scientific literature, I noticed that image analysis methods were often absent or hidden by only briefly mentioning the used image analysis software. This made reproduction often very difficult.\nIn publications image analysis is only one of many different methods scientists utilize to produce quantitative results. This scientific skill is increasingly taught in many courses at academic institutions. Also many online resources in different formats exist that help scientists to perform image analysis correctly:\n\n\nWritten tutorials: BioImageBook\n\n\nVideos: find on e.g., youtube\n\n\nPublications: Start with this & links therein\n\n\nFurthermore, there is also a growing community of scientists specialized in image analysis. You can get directly in touch with this community via image.sc. In this forum you can find many solutions and helpful materials, for instance in the following post you will find a vast collection of training materials for image analysis. However, clear instructions or guidelines how image analysis should be documented in research papers were missing. This is another reason that is making it hard for authors to effectively publish good image analysis methods.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Image Analysis: (A) With image analysis workflows quantitative data is extracted from images.

    "text": "Bringing image analysis into the light\nHelena Jambor then started a fantastic effort within Quarep-LiMi to improve publications of microscopy images. She brought me in as a Co-chair and together with many different scientists and experts in image analysis and microscopy we were able to distill core aspects of good image analysis methods in publications. We focused on giving practical and easy to execute advice in three different categories of image analysis methods that we commonly see used in research papers (Fig. Publication of image analysis):\n\n\nEstablished workflows\n\nNew workflows\n\nMachine learning workflows\n\nWe hope that these checklist will enhance the work of scientists and make their life easier by giving clear and actionable instructions for the publication of images and image analysis.\n\nRead the Nature Methods paper here\n\n\nFind the checklist to download as printable files here.\n\n\nA companion Jupyter Book is available here.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Publication of image analysis: Image data is transformed into results using image analysis workflows. In the literature we see that authors use established analysis workflows, new workflows and machine learning workflows. In our checklists we give essential advice on how to publish these methods."

I previously wrote about one example published by Miura and Norrelykke, which illustrated that the sequence of contrast adjustment and image cropping matter. I regularly witness the education gap in image handling in my DataViz courses. Graduate students ask: Is it ok to turn images? Can I crop away a neighboring cell? Am I allowed to show green fluorescent protein in red? When images are processed without in-depth knowledge of the software, accidentally misleading images may be the result.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Sequence matters when adjusting brightness contrast.

    "text": "Last week I was invited to the ASCB Subgroup “Science and Art: Bridging Two Creative Universes“ . Artists shows subjective views of the world, while biologists measure life, which seem like opposites. Where they converge is in their shared goal to communicate their ideas and insights. And nowhere are they as close as in the communication with data visualizations.\n\n\nI am neither a cell biologist (anymore), nor an artist. But my work is to make data understandable through visualization. Data visualization is about finding truthful, insightful, and pleasing representations for messy, uncertain, and complicated biological data. And to create effective visualizations, we use techniques from the arts. I am fully behind the notion of the organisers, that there is an “impact of artistic practices on scientific research and communication“. In my talk I show how concepts from art make data visualizations work.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Art concepts we use in data visualization\n\n\n\n\n\nArt expresses itself in many representations, from sculpture to video, and these evolve over time. In data visualizations we also rely on a pool of representations we can choose from, and these are the chart types. Each serves a different purpose, some are intuitive, and others require prior training.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Pick a suitable representation for your data. For numerical data numerous charts exists and new forms keep being invented.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstraction is used constantly in science. We take a picture of cute animals, make continuous observations of molecular interactions, or take snapshots of genomes – each is a simplification into 1s and 0s, which then can be averaged, correlated, and tested.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: All data are just 1s and 0s.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we turn 1s and 0s into visualizations for inspection, we use of the preattentive cues to find outliers, patterns or to draw attention.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Our eyes see visual cues such as line width, color, decorations, and absences.\n\n\n\n\n\nData visualization relies on human visual perception. From magicians, we that our visual senses can be tricked. In science we want to avoid this to not mislead our audiences. Therefore, we established rules for scientists how to faithfully present data.\n\n\n  \nFigure 5: Resources: Tracey’s paper about  misleading bar charts, our paper about unclear image figures, our workflow, with cheatsheets!, for image processing, and our checklists for publishing  image data.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt times, we see that rules get broken. Currently, against best practice, 3D-effects are making a comeback in charts. Usually, these charts do not necessarily want to present data the best way, but merely grab the attention of the visually overstimulated audience.\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Trained data visualizers consider 3D effects misleading - a new generation seems to disagree and fancy some cool effects here and there!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe purpose of attention grabbing is to elicit an emotional response. Emotional responses get people engaged and known to enhance comprehension and memory. Any emotional response works for this, so in art and data visualization we can use humor, horror and of course beauty. For our patient communication project used a calming and somewhat pretty visualization to help cancer patients understand their treatment course.\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Emotions help us understand and remember.\n\n\n\n\n\nJust as in art, also in data visualization we are not impartial to trends. Just check out the below iterations of a figure - can you guess which was fashionable when? Check out Isaac and James paper to find out which we considered pretty in 2023 - and how they show us that cells can survive happily with JUST TWO LIPIDS!\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Each generation has their favorite color scheme for data.\n\n\n\n\n\nGet all the reading material, including the first book on data visualization for life science from 1885!\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Scan link for lots of papers. Or not.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease also check out the great work by all the other speakers: Dave Goodsell does not need any introduction, his work is shared widely and who has not seen the colorful structures of cells! Gaia Pigino explored ways to use art to even make her own science more fun for herself, while Mary O’Reilly shared fun ways to increase creativity in our illustrations and Christopher Prinz told his personal story of heightening the game of his lab with art. Thao Do and Mol Mir try to bring art to the scientists in their respective institutes, while Leonora Martínez-Nuñez uses art to publicize science to a public. Representation with sculptures was definingly a theme, maybe we need some haptic, real-world objects after a decade of big data. We learned about ceramics from Duygu Ozpolat, glass art from Alex Ritter, and metal welding from Bryan Welm. And finally, Melanie Stegman introduced a relatively new format, video games, as another flower in the bouquet of possibilities to make science fun and accessible to wide audiences. In the evening we got a chance to visit the SEAS Disease Biophysics Group headed by Kit Parker. They are trying to advance bioengineering in many directions but also incorporate creative techniques of the arts into their research and artists into their labs - for a fruitful exchange if ideas and apporaches. And were treated to “drumroll” WALKING TACOs! I did eat out of a bag for the first time in my life.\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Walking taco, skeptical look is before diggin’ in!\n\n\nA big thank you to the organizers, Beata Mierzwa, Francesca Bartolini and Carsten Janke!!"

    "text": "My Advent of doodles\nI sketch a little something most days, usually in the morning. Hence, I make a lot of drawings of my mug or other breakfast items. In December, I wanted to explore ways for encoding quantities. Starting from 1 all the way to 24 I tried out different marks to show increasingly large numbers. I was wondering which would be clear, or easy to decode, or just pretty. Enjoy my little data-vis advent calendar!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: 1 is tricky - it needs something around, a frame, to really focus the attention on the one dot, or the one mark etc. When it is enclosed by a rectangle it appears more like position is communicated - not the quantity. 2 items can already form a line, a visual group - it is getting easier to recognize that a quantity is shown. I like the mountains and waves :) And, again, the Cartesian coordinates are confusing and distract from a quantity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: 3 works nicely with dots, lines or rectanges, and still works with waves and mountains. 3 was fun! Oh, and 4 was even more fun - maybe I am also getting the hang ot it. I tried dots, lines, round lines, rectangles, clouds and drops. I feel like the “stairs” going up is not working at all - and also waves and dots in RANDOM (bottom left) order is getting tricky already.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Fun ways for 5 - i think it is most clear when items are neatly arranged. The many fun ways, flowers starts etc work probalby a lot better as multiples - when we can compare petal number or flame number etc. Now: 6! Pity I used a blue pen! But I leave it - errors are the beauty of real sketches. Six is not possible at all anymore as waves! And surprisingly tricky as petals - it may be me, but an uneven number is much better to see!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Impossible to see at first glance “7” in and of these. Too much for visually comprehension? We are now at “Magic number 7”, the limit Miller defined we can perceive pre-attentively. Given that seven was already challenging for me, I started to play with groupings for 8. Two lines, two rows of rectangles etc. The only iterations that I find easy are the tile-array (bottom left) and the system used in pubs etc, of four lines where fifth line goes across.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Same as eight, 9 works best when it forms groups. Really easy are 3x3 goups, or rectangles, lines, or dots. I even once supported grouping by proximity with an enclosure (looks like 3 traffic lights sideways, third row, second from right), I know the Gestalt principles! For 10 mostly same as nine - if grouped it works well (second row right examples), even with tricky shapes (bottom line, little “plants”).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n\nFigure 6: I have given up on being able to visually count - instead I just play around with shapes and groups. Readable imo are only the few that are using the talling system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n\nFigure 7: 15 to 18…. Getting messier! If you want clarity, tallying is the only hope, but for attraction the grouped flowers are starting to become interesting - and interesting is not bad, it captures attention and let’s readers linger a little longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     \n\n\nFigure 8: Oh well, at this point it does not matter anymore, but there are now so many items it becomes joyful to look at. Symmetries can be formed and broken, which is interesting! And flower bed are blooming :=)\n\n\nThis was fun! I guess there really is no point going onwards to New Years. The more items we got, the more important becomes their layouting and organisation. Happy new year and see you for next years advent challenge!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Datavis at the oncology unit\nYou all know I love data visualizations for science communication. But in the past 5 years, I worked in the oncology unit, and started to research how visual aids can be effectively used in cancer care.\nWhen cancer patients begin treatment, they feel overwhelmed, anxious, and intimidated by the hospital setting. This stress can significantly reduce how much information they retain. On average, patients remember only about 20% of the critical treatment details provided by their healthcare team.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Example visual aid for communicating treatment path for a patient with multiple myeloma.\n\n\n\n\n\nVisual aid comprehension\nTo bridge this health literacy gap and enhance treatment adherence, we explored the use of visual aids to support doctor-patient communication during cancer treatments. Our study reveals that these visual aids are not only clear and easy to understand, but also significantly improve comprehension of medical information and prove highly beneficial in clinical settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Visual aids increasd participants response quality and confidence. Based on questionnaire with 160 participants.\n\n\n\nWe for example showed that the response quality was increased,from 68% to 84%, when participants were informed about cancer treatment with a visual aid. More importantly, these aids boosted participants’ confidence in their understanding and led to higher ratings of information quality. We also assessed the clarity of the visual aids; the pictograms used to represent key terms were mostly interpretable and considered effective by 300 participants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Example of visual representations for “hospital” - pictogram and comic were much more guessable than photo. Based on questionnaire of 306 participants.\n\n\n\n\n\nPatients use of visual aids\nA critical part of our research focused on the patient experiences (all approved by ethics board). With the help of visual aids, patients were able to better understand and remember their treatment paths, retaining key information for several weeks. Both patients and physicians found the visual aids to be very helpful, and many patients kept and treasured their aids.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Patient responses to qualitative questions. Based on interviews with 30 patients.\n\n\n\nOur work underscores the value of visual aids in clinical settings and motivates us to continue working towards greater equity in patient-centered care and improving doctor-patient communication.

    "title": "Win the Poster Prize",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Win the Poster Prize (Or, at least, produce nice posters while trying)\nStudents on average author 1-3 papers and produce at least three times that many conference posters (see our study). At large meetings, such as the ASCB, thousands of posters are presented each year. While presenting posters is popular, posters sessions evoke mixed feelings: they are often late in the evening, interrupted by special workshops, held in badly lit rooms far away from the bar, and many posters are subpar: they are crammed with details and text in small font, and presenters elaborate in great detail. Experienced conference attendees therefore excel in the brief scanning of the title while avoiding eye contact with the presenter for fear of being entangled in a never-ending run-down of experimental details.\nWhile we can’t influence the conference organization, we can absolutely and with little effort improve the posters! Based on my survey data, I compiled the top ten tips to improve your poster:\n\n\nLegible title\nMake the title and your name readable from afar. This means, not too many words per title, maybe 6 to 10, in a legible font – Helvetica Neue, Verdana, Calibri or similar. Refrain also from ALL CAPS as it becomes hard to read after a few words. If you love all caps, why not try Small Caps with capitalization instead.\n\n\nAvoid abbreviations\nIdeally no abbreviations in the title and as few as possible in the poster content. Only few abbreviations are so common that they became words themselves: DNA, RNA, some gene and protein names. You don’t want to turn audience away with jargon, and remember, even specialist’s conferences are attended by editors, journalists, and newcomers in the field – be welcoming to them all!\n\n\nNot too much text\nWe read maximally 100-200 words per minute – but in posters, with scientific data, terms, and charts our reading speed will be significantly decreased. Keep that in mind – I personally am more convinced by a figure than by you explaining and interpreting it.\n\n\nClear section layout\nStart at the top left and end at the bottom right. This is how we read text, and also posters! Alternative: arrange your content in 2-3 columns, similar to an article – make sure the columns are clear by leaving enough white space surrounding them! Please refrain from unconventional layouts – the chances are high that it will confuse your readers!\n\n \nOrganization and layout is key: commit to one reading direction and then stick to either column or row layout.\n\n\n\nFigure titles instead of legends\nThis is easy – try moving the figure legend above the image/chart, instead of showing it below as you would in a paper. Right away, this gives you a header for that section! Explanations of the color code, which are critical to understand a figure, can be sub-headers!\n\n\nIncrease legibility with figure titles instead of figure legends!\n\n\n\nConsistent color code\nAbsolutely keep the color code consistent across all figures! Nothing kills more time than figuring out the color code of each individual chart! Please, if your main experiment/mutant/condition is shown in “red” in the first figure, do not deviate from this in the next figure! And, of course, be color-blind friendly (no mixing red and green!)\n\n\nPick a consistent color scheme. Experiment in red, control in blue? Do not use these colors for anything else.\n\n\n\nSimple pictures and charts.\nThere is likely fascinating detail in your data, but not everyone wants to know all of it during a poster session. Therefore, please consider removing unnecessary details from your graphs! (Also: avoid 3D, no bar charts for distributions (#BarBarCharts) and avoid unconventional graph-types: it’s already unlikely people understand them in a paper, and less likely they feel like deciphering them in a poster session.\n\n\nPoster-Etiquette: Have the elevator pitch ready!\nGive your audience a polite overview in 2-3 minutes that includes the big picture and key finding, but leave out experimental details. If they are interested in more, they will ask! (Also, it is convenient to have this 2-minute blurb ready in case you accidentally bump into the heroine/hero of your field in the coffee line, instead of at the poster session!)\n\n\nRehearse whenever you can!\nFind 10 volunteers, not necessarily your supervisor only, to test out your 2-minute presentation; while in the lunch line, when waiting for a measurement to finish, or when cleaning the bench.\n\n\nTricks are allowed.\nTo get people interested in your poster, you can use tricks. Have handouts ready to take home, bring a laptop to show movies, I’ve seen people hand out sweets, and know someone that served beers – everything is allowed when trying to convince people to read your poster!\n\n\nFurther reading:\nA really nice paper on how to give a poster presentation is here: “Producing punchy posters” by Bernard S. Brown, in Trends in Cell biology, Vol. 6, 1996. He mainly deals with text, and less with figures, but has been helpful for me for 20 years! link to article"

    "title": "How to… Poster Design",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Poster preparation: The ultimate resource guide\nWith the pandemic over for good, we are truly back to in-person conferences and their packed poster sessions. Think about the numbers: each year, well over hundred thousand poster are presented at academic and industry networking events. Think about the effort: each poster is made in many hours spent trying to concisely communicate a message. Think about the room for improvements see also my article: many of the posters are densely filled with text and fail to “spark joy”. Here is the second part of my poster-how-to, tips for tools and visuals for better posters in 2024:\n\n\nTools for poster preparation\nNumerous tools exist that help scientists prepare electronic posters for conferences. Common are software for designing slides, vector-design software, and web based applications. Vector design software allow for zooming of visualizations without quality loss – meaning not pixelation will suddenly appear when a poster designed on small screen is printed at life size. Here is a roundup of some useful ones:\n\nOpen source software\n\nInkscape: A free vector graphic software that is rapidly being developed and becoming more usable every day. In Inkscape you can directly import of icons from icon libraries, e.g., when needing symbols. Inkscape also permits scripting: images can be processed with ImageJ and data can be visualized with R inside Inkscape. Plus, a practical guide for biologists exists (Cvrčková, 2019 - pay or scihub).\nImageJ/FIJI: An open-source image processing software, offers extensive possibilities for image processing. For layouting of posters primarily composed of images, software extensions (“plugins”) can be used, e.g., ScientiFig or FigureJ. Both plugins allow users to arrange multiple images, graphs, and annotations into a single composite figure and has tools for aligning, resizing, and labeling images.\n\n\n\nSoftware\n\nAdobe Illustrator / Affinity Designer / CorelDraw: The proprietary alternatives to Inkscape. Adobe Illustrator is widely used and tutorials help new users along (Culley, 2016).\nPowerPoint / Keynote: Often PowerPoint will produce posters of sufficient quality, especially when the canvas size is adjusted and slides are exported as vector graphics such as PDF. When saving your graphical abstract check the settings to make sure that your images are not compressed to prevent pixelation artifacts.\n\n\n\nWeb-based\n\nFlourish: online data visualization tool that allows users to create visually appealing charts – which can be combined into data-driven posters. Flourish has numerous customizable templates for common but also uncommon charts. Plus, can handle relatively large datasets.\nFigma: is mostly used for prototyping in design, but I have come across many people that use it also use it for poster design. A plus, it allows collaborative work and graphic editing, and the outputs are vector graphic designs. Especially for collaborative work and prototyping Figma can be integrated with a number of other tools, e.g. SLACK, Adobe Cloud, Confluence, Dropbox etc.\nCanva: used for designing visuals for many purposes, popular for its user-friendly interface. Includes a number of templates, a built-in icon and photo library, and also permits real-time collaboration. It is possible to upload contents, such as microscopy image, charts, or user icons, such as the logo of your institute or funder. *BioRender: proprietary web-based software with a very large biomedical icon library, whose appearance, shape, color, and detail, cannot be changed. A drawback to many labs is also BioRender’s continuous adaptation of licenses, while an advantage is the its interface with public databases, such as the Protein Data Bank.\nMindtheGraph: MindtheGraph is an online platform designed to help users create scientifically accurate and visually appealing illustrations, particularly for academic and research purposes. It offers a Also includes a library of pre-made scientific illustrations and templates. User-friendly drag and drop, and collaborative mode are possible.\n\nFor a more thorough review of common software and their advantages/disadvantages:\n\nMartin, K., 2020. A picture is worth a thousand words. MEW 29, 28–34.\nPerkel, J.M., 2020. The software that powers scientific illustration. Nature 582, 137–138. see paper\n\n\n\n\nCatchy visuals\nThe first thing most audiences see from afar are key visuals. These can be large pictures, charts, icons, or a simple graphical abstract. Some posters even are entirely visual, presenting data in a story format e.g. as a comic strip. In particular icons and symbols, which we learn early and thus understand almost intuitively, work well when we want to rapidly grab attention. Icons can even replace or support text, e.g. in titles, legends, or axis labels. Today, we have a vast number or open access resources at our fingertips, and the collection of free icon is expanding daily. Most resources contain icons in either adaptable format (“SVG”) or as image (“PNG”), or both.\n\nGeneral icons:\n\nFontawesome is a Unicode-based icon library that can be installed locally as a font for graphic programs, downloaded as full icon library, or downloaded as individual SVG images.\nNounproject a collection of icons from various designers. Hence, the available icons are vast, but also not matched in style. These icons can be used after registration for free with attribution as SVG or PNG.\nSVGrepo currently largest SVG icon library, icons are searchable by style.\nFlaticon\n\n\n\nBiology & Medicine icons\n\nPhylopic offers shapes of numerous animals, plants and further model organisms, e.g. for phylogenetic trees.\nEBI icon library provides some general scientific icons.\nReactome provides scientific pictograms and chemical drawings for free re-use and encourages the upload of user-designed pictograms for sharing with the scientific community.\nSmart is a free collection of medical drawings from Servier Medical Art and can be downloaded as a full slide-deck and used with attribution.\nBioicons is an expanding set of biology and laboratory icons from petri dishes to model organisms available under free licenses (CC0). Initially by Servier, the drawings are expanded with user provided samples.\nHealth Icons is a global volunteer effort to create common icons for many specialized medical scenarios available under creative commons license (CC0).\nSciDraw is a repository of free SVG cartoons for science supported by the Sainsbury Wellcome Centre, UK\nHealthicons offer many icons specifically dedicated to medical procedures, diagnoses, and eqipment that is not often included in regular icon libraries.\n\nFor inspiration check out the first icon library, designed by Gerd Arntz for the Isotype project in the early 1900s. Despite Otto Neurath and Gerd Arntz intending the isotype project as a common worldwide visual language, their relatives decided to hold copyright link.\n\n\n\nUnderstandable title and text\nThe number of words that Bernard Brown showed on his poster about poster design is 131 – and he hints to the fact that this may be enough for academic conference posters. Thus, concise writing is essential for posters.\n\n\nBrown - producing punchy posters\n\nBut the first impression of a poster comes from a title – if this is cluttered with abbreviations clear to you and your labmates but not the wider attendees, they might not dare to stop. But even the title should also be short and there is science to support this. Letford et al analysed 20,000 papers and showed that the shorter the title, the more citations a paper received. This may be multiple factors, but one aspect is that shorter titles are easier to understand.\n\n\nThe advantage of short paper titles, figure from letchford 2015.\n\n\n\nCatchy Colorschemes\nThe industrial designer Henry Dreyfuss is cited saying that “colours are the exclamation marks in design” – color perception is immediate and we cannot ignore colors. Colors should be used 1. To focus the attention, by applying color where readers should look first; 2. Consistently, colorschemes should not change from one panel to the next if they have the same meaning; 3. Accessible to all audiences, i.e., colors should have high contrast to background and be visible to colorblind.\n\nTools for Colors:\n\nTest accessibility of your colours, e.g., by rendering your display (iOS: accessibility&gt;display&gt;colorfilters) or by uploading a screenshot of the poster to a web-tool.\nCheck color contrast:\nColor blind friendly?\nPick colors for data\nTest if colors work with charts\n2500* palettes, searchable, exportable!! Yan Holz did it again..\n\n\n\nDesign a color scheme:\n\npaletton\nAdobe color\n\n\n\nPick color from image:\n\nIcolorpalette\nhexcolor\n\n\n\n\nNew poster formats\nA lasting effect from COVID times is that conference formats have forever become more diverse. Hybrid conferences are here to stay to accommodate various reasons for virtual attendance, from care work at home, limited travel budgets, or problems getting visa’s. Hybrid conferences have not only online or hybrid poster sessions, but often also poster flash talks or online-only rooms for mingling, e.g. in gather town. This diversity requires more preparation – the poster flash talk needs one easy and pretty slide with the key information, the digital poster usually is smaller than its print counterpart, and the online-room require an extra level of confidence.\n\n\nPrepare!\nAnd last, get feedback on the poster before print and have a short “Elevator pitch” ready. You may only have one minute to grab the attention of someone in the coffee line, rushing past your poster, so a ready-to-fire run-down of the main points is essential. For feeedback, get your colleaagues to speficifcally comment on the readability of poster text and figures. It turns out that most poster presenters do not receive feedback before hitting the print button See paper. Two questions you may ask: 1. What do you see first? This ideally is the title and the key visual, if not revise. 2. Ask someone to explain the poster back to you. When they get stuck it usually is because something is not quite clear. You can also use this silly “Bad Poster Bingo” to make sure your poster does not disappoint.\n\n\nEnjoy a game of bad poster bingo - or check it to avoid common mistakes.
