<p>Never have I ever had such great responses from reviewers - it was a joy to attend to the few very good suggestions they had for improving the manuscript! Reviewer 2 and 3 were similarly enthusiastic: “Congratulations for laying out your perspective.” and “Overall, the paper is a beneficial guide for researchers looking to effectively communicate their research through graphical abstracts.” A day to mark in my calendar!</p>
<p>I am happy to finally share with you that the summary of my Graphical Abstract blogs is now available as paper for you all to share and cite! Out in <a href="https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011789">PLOS Computational Biology.</a></p>

<section id="my-advent-of-doodles" class="level1">
<h1>My Advent of doodles</h1>
<p>I sketch a little something most days, usually in the morning. Hence, I make a lot of drawings of my mug or other breakfast items. In December, I wanted to explore ways for encoding quantities. Starting from 1 all the way to 24 I tried out different marks to show increasingly large numbers. I was wondering which would be clear, or easy to decode, or just pretty. Enjoy my little data-vis advent calendar!</p>
<div id="fig-one" class="quarto-layout-panel">

</div>
</div>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure&nbsp;1: 1 is tricky - it needs something around, a frame, to really focus the attention on the one dot, or the one mark etc. When it is enclosed by a rectangle it appears more like position is communicated - not the quantity. 2 items can already form a line, a visual group - it is getting easier to recognize that a quantity is shown. I like the mountains and waves :) And, again, the Cartesian coordinates are confusing and distract from a quantity.</figcaption><p></p>

Oh, and 4 was even more fun - maybe I am also getting the hang ot it. I tried dots, lines, round lines, rectangles, clouds and drops. I feel like the “stairs” going up is not working at all - and also waves and dots in RANDOM (bottom left) order is getting tricky already.</figcaption><p></p>

The many fun ways, flowers starts etc work probalby a lot better as multiples - when we can compare petal number or flame number etc. Now: 6! Pity I used a blue pen! But I leave it - errors are the beauty of real sketches. Six is not possible at all anymore as waves! And surprisingly tricky as petals - it may be me, but an uneven number is much better to see!</figcaption><p></p>

We are now at “Magic number 7”, the limit Miller defined we can perceive pre-attentively. Given that seven was already challenging for me, I started to play with groupings for 8. Two lines, two rows of rectangles etc. The only iterations that I find easy are the tile-array (bottom left) and the system used in pubs etc, of four lines where fifth line goes across.</figcaption><p></p>

I even once supported grouping by proximity with an enclosure (looks like 3 traffic lights sideways, third row, second from right), I know the Gestalt principles! For 10 mostly same as nine - if grouped it works well (second row right examples), even with tricky shapes (bottom line, little “plants”).</figcaption><p></p>

<section id="do-images-tell-the-truth" class="level1">
<h1>Do images tell the truth?</h1>
<p>Objectivity and truth matter in scientific images, especially as we use them to communicate insights about life and the universe. Today, AI is igniting debates in microscopy imaging. Does AI accurately emnhances reality? Are hallucinations introduced? And what defines a truly “raw” image in the era of advanced microscopes? For the Christmas edition of the <a href="https://journals.biologists.com/jcs/article/136/24/jcs261837/337758/A-community-driven-approach-to-enhancing-the?guestAccessKey=eb13a893-aad0-4291-a2f6-3748eb1941b4">Journal of Cell Sciences</a>, I wrote about our community efforts towards improving images in publication and put our work into a historical perspective.</p>

<section id="enlightenment-drawings" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="enlightenment-drawings">Enlightenment &amp; drawings</h2>
<p>Debates about truth in images did not arise with AI. While the imaging methods are new, the discussions about image objectivity has long historical roots. In the Enlightenment era, similar discussions happened around drawings, and duelists were the observing scientists, their scientific illustrators and copperplate engravers. Even then, achieving objectivity was tough and “fixing the empirically variable, excluding the accidental, and eliminating the impure,” as Goethe noted, was daunting in images.</p>
</section>
<section id="photography" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="photography">Photography</h2>
<p>Photography was a game-changer in the 18 hundreds, as AI is today. Arthur Worthington’s captures this well. Worthington drew the shape of falling drops in their nearly otherworldly symmetry. Shocked by his first photos, revealing the irregular nature of the splashes, he wrote “the mind of the observer is filled with an ideal splash, whose perfection may never be realized.” Highly recommend his book “Romance of Science Series - The Splash of a Drop” - free <a href="http://archive.org/details/splashofdrop00wortuoft">on the Internet Archive</a>.</p>

<section id="image-adjustments-then-and-now" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="image-adjustments-then-and-now">Image adjustments, then and now</h2>
<p>Early photography needed a lot of “effort and artifice” (Daston, Objectivity). Early pics were often coarse and had to be tweeked to show anything at all. What was acceptable and what was misleading? An <a href="https://archive.org/details/b2192532x">early textbook for microscopy images</a> from 1890 gives us a clue: splicing images was commonly practiced for efficiency, while altering background colors raised concerns about potential manipulation. Its author Neuhauss also writes that “all measures that uniformly impact the entire image are unequivocally permissible,” a notion almost unchanged in contemporary guides for the now digital images (Cromey, 2013).</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="community-efforts">Community efforts</h2>
<p>The gap between what scientists see and what tech shows will remain. Bridging it and finding consensus what images tell the truth will always need collective efforts and debates in the scientific community.</p>

<section id="saturday-is-art-day-at-ascb" class="level1">
<h1>Saturday is Art-Day at ASCB!</h1>
<p>Last week I was invited to the <a href="https://www.ascb.org/cellbio2023/program/subgroups/">ASCB Subgroup “Science and Art: Bridging Two Creative Universes“ </a>. Artists shows subjective views of the world, while biologists measure life, which seem like opposites. Where they converge is in their shared goal to communicate their ideas and insights. And nowhere are they as close as in the communication with data visualizations.</p>
<section id="what-i-spoke-about" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-i-spoke-about">What I spoke about</h2>
<p>I am neither a cell biologist (anymore), nor an artist. But my work is to make data understandable through visualization. Data visualization is about finding truthful, insightful, and pleasing representations for messy, uncertain, and complicated biological data. And to create effective visualizations, we use techniques from the arts. I am fully behind the notion of the organisers, that there is an “impact of artistic practices on scientific research and communication“. In my talk I show how concepts from art make data visualizations work.</p>

</figure>
</div>
</section>
<section id="representation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="representation">Representation</h2>
<p>Art expresses itself in many representations, from sculpture to video, and these evolve over time. In data visualizations we also rely on a pool of representations we can choose from, and these are the chart types. Each serves a different purpose, some are intuitive, and others require prior training.</p>

</figure>
</div>
</section>
<section id="abstraction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstraction">Abstraction</h2>
<p>Abstraction is used constantly in science. We take a picture of cute animals, make continuous observations of molecular interactions, or take snapshots of genomes – each is a simplification into 1s and 0s, which then can be averaged, correlated, and tested.</p>

</figure>
</div>
</section>
<section id="pattern-recognition" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pattern-recognition">Pattern recognition</h2>
<p>When we turn 1s and 0s into visualizations for inspection, we use of the preattentive cues to find outliers, patterns or to draw attention.</p>

</div>
</section>
<section id="rules" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="rules">Rules</h2>
<p>Data visualization relies on human visual perception. From magicians, we that our visual senses can be tricked. In science we want to avoid this to not mislead our audiences. Therefore, we established rules for scientists how to faithfully present data.</p>

<p>At times, we see that rules get broken. Currently, against best practice, 3D-effects are making a comeback in charts. Usually, these charts do not necessarily want to present data the best way, but merely grab the attention of the visually overstimulated audience.</p>

<p>The purpose of attention grabbing is to elicit an emotional response. Emotional responses get people engaged and known to enhance comprehension and memory. Any emotional response works for this, so in art and data visualization we can use humor, horror and of course beauty. For our patient communication project used a calming and somewhat pretty visualization to help cancer patients understand their treatment course.</p>

<p>Please also check out the great work by all the other speakers: <a href="https://ccsb.scripps.edu/goodsell/">Dave Goodsell</a> does not need any introduction, his work is shared widely and who has not seen the colorful structures of cells! <a href="https://humantechnopole.it/en/people/gaia-pigino/">Gaia Pigino</a> explored ways to use art to even make her own science more fun for herself, while Mary O’Reilly shared fun ways to increase creativity in our illustrations and Christopher Prinz told his personal story of heightening the game of his lab with art. Thao Do and Mol Mir try to bring art to the scientists in their respective institutes, while Leonora Martínez-Nuñez uses art to publicize science to a public. Representation with sculptures was definingly a theme, maybe we need some haptic, real-world objects after a decade of big data. We learned about ceramics from Duygu Ozpolat, glass art from Alex Ritter, and metal welding from Bryan Welm. And finally, <a href="https://new.mica.edu/undergraduate-majors-minors/game-design-major/melanie-stegman/">Melanie Stegman</a> introduced a relatively new format, video games, as another flower in the bouquet of possibilities to make science fun and accessible to wide audiences. In the evening we got a chance to visit the SEAS Disease Biophysics Group headed by Kit Parker. They are trying to advance bioengineering in many directions but also incorporate creative techniques of the arts into their research and artists into their labs - for a fruitful exchange if ideas and apporaches. And were treated to “drumroll” WALKING TACOs! I did eat out of a bag for the first time in my life.</p>

<p>I care about science and images that is widely accessible. At present, that is not always the case. Image figures are confusing and unclear. I have <a href="../../posts/Image_numbers/index.html">written</a> and <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001161"> published</a> about communicating understandable image data, and last week <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-023-01987-9">our community-developed guidelines for publishing understandable images</a> got published.</p>
<p>For scientists it is worth investing time in producing clear papers: incomprehensible data is demonstrably less read, less often cited, and unlikely to be included in the scientific canon. Don’t believe me? <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26361556/">Letchford et al</a> have data!</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="accidentally-misleading-images">Accidentally misleading images</h2>
<p>Published images at times are not just unclear but misleading. This may be because image data was incorrectly processed. I <a href="../../posts/Image_how_mag/index.html">previously wrote about one example published by Miura and Norrelykke</a>, which illustrated that the sequence of contrast adjustment and image cropping matter. I regularly witness the education gap in image handling in my DataViz courses. Graduate students ask: Is it ok to turn images? Can I crop away a neighboring cell? Am I allowed to show green fluorescent protein in red? When images are processed without in-depth knowledge of the software, accidentally misleading images may be the result.</p>

<p>Less common than accidentally misleading images, are instances of intentional image manipulation. These are cases when authors fabricate or forge data to mislead audiences. Elisabeth Bik has brought attention to this problem and also quantified instances of image manipulations in publications.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="hidden-image-analysis">Hidden image analysis</h2>
<p>As a Research Data Scientist I engage in many different collaborative scientific projects, particularly focusing on the analysis of microscopy image data (Fig. 1). Turning to the scientific literature, I noticed that image analysis methods were often absent or hidden by only briefly mentioning the used image analysis software. This made reproduction often very difficult.</p>
In publications image analysis is only one of many different methods scientists utilize to produce quantitative results. This scientific skill is increasingly taught in many courses at academic institutions. Also many online resources in different formats exist that help scientists to perform image analysis correctly:
<ul>
<li>
Written tutorials: <a href="https://bioimagebook.github.io/">BioImageBook</a>
</li>
<li>
Videos: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZBsjrcYiw-c?si=94OpKKrXc49br3bD">find on e.g., youtube</a>
</li>
<li>
Publications: <a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/9-1373">Start with this &amp; links therein</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, there is also a growing community of scientists specialized in image analysis. You can get directly in touch with this community via <a href=" https://forum.image.sc/">image.sc</a>. In this forum you can find many solutions and helpful materials, for instance in the following post you will find <a href="https://forum.image.sc/t/bioimage-analysis-recommended-reading-and-viewing/28051
">a vast collection of training materials for image analysis</a>. However, clear instructions or guidelines how image analysis should be documented in research papers were missing. This is another reason that is making it hard for authors to effectively publish good image analysis methods.</p>

Helena Jambor then started a fantastic effort within Quarep-LiMi to improve publications of microscopy images. She brought me in as a Co-chair and together with many different scientists and experts in image analysis and microscopy we were able to distill core aspects of good image analysis methods in publications. We focused on giving practical and easy to execute advice in three different categories of image analysis methods that we commonly see used in research papers (Fig. Publication of image analysis):
<ul>
<li>
Established workflows
</li><li>
New workflows
</li><li>
Machine learning workflows
</li></ul>
<p>We hope that these checklist will enhance the work of scientists and make their life easier by giving clear and actionable instructions for the publication of images and image analysis.</p>

<p>Our guidelines for image and image analyses publishing just got published for you all <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-023-01987-9"> in Nature Methods</a>. This was a long journey, here is how it came about:</p>
<section id="some-images-oh-my" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="some-images-oh-my">Some images, oh my!</h2>
<p>In 2016/2017 I was a fellow at the <a href="https://www.wiko-berlin.de/">Institute for Advanced Studies</a> and prepping a data visualisation curriculum, which included image figures. Screening for teaching examples I found that many, many authors were still happily publishing red/green color combinations in both charts and also in microscopy images, thus making their science visually inaccessible to colour-blind readers <a href="https://thenode.biologists.com/color-blind-audiences/photo/">(see my post at TheNode)</a>.</p>

<section id="we-collected-numbers-oh-dear" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="we-collected-numbers-oh-dear">We collected numbers, OH DEAR!</h2>
<p>At the 2018 <a href="https://meetings.embo.org/event/18-lsm">Light Sheet conference</a> microscopy fans gathered to discuss awesome images. Except me, I was still stunned by the subpar images I had seen in papers. I ended up chatting with Rita Strack, editor at Nature Methods about journal strategies to ensure image figures are legible (none back then!) and my idea for a survey. The idea evolved into a project when I teamed up with Tracey Weissgerber in the eLIFE ambassador programme. Tracey had experience with meta-research (i.e.&nbsp;screening literature) and with out group we analyzed published images with a standardized protocol. Now we had numbers for what previously was just an impression: lots of pictures didn’t have sizes marks, giving readers a little guessing game time. The colors? Turns out, many were like secret codes that only the authors could understand. Plus, the explanations often barely enlightened - check ourpaper <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001161">in PLOS BIO</a></p>

<p>Our PLOS BIO paper got me onto the (virtual, remember COVID!) stage of the 2020 meeting of the German Bioimaging society. The Q&amp;A was a lively discussion of many impossible ways to improve image communication and one clear idea: let’s form a <a href="https://quarep.org/">QUAREP</a> working group for this! Starting with just four members, we hashed, clashed, and conjured what eventually became the checklists for image publishing. Quickly our <a href="https://quarep.org/working-groups/wg-12-image-visualization-and-analysis/">Working Group 12</a> grew and became very interdisciplinary: we have members from research institutes, medical clinics, and even NASA; from all continents and time-zones; from applied research, companies and theory. Safe to say, we also at times failed to find a consensus and tip toed around some topics until we dropped them. Our opinions also differed on how strict we wanted to be with guidelines but also there found a workable compromise between our ideals and reality. In the end, all scientists globally, also those with little access to advanced microscopy facilities, should be empowered to reach the minimal goals, while at the same time we also wanted to push some higher image and image analysis standards. This lead to the the three levels, mandatory, recommended and ideal.</p>

<p>Fuelled by caffeine and italian carbs at the Human Technopole in Milan, a writing-weekend produced the first draft that was improved in feedback rounds with many of our QUAREP-LiMi friends and colleages. The extended vetting was helpful, with just one round of small revisions our manuscript was accepted by our first choice journal, Nature Methods. Coincidentally, it was handled by Rita Strack, who I believe does not even remember our brief coffee line conversation about this project many years agon! And now we give the checklists to all of you scientists – These are not lists, but the audacious result of chasing pixel perfection in scientific zoom calls. For me personally it was a rewarding experience to collaborate with so many people, and from now I will keep meeting co-authors at many meetings to come!</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-very-short-history-of-bio-images">(A very short) History of Bio-Images</h2>
<p>Images communicate scientific observations long before photography and light microscopy were invented. The first evidences of images were drawings in medical and pharmaceutical text books from antiquity. While these drawings to us today seem almost like art, they very much served a scientific purpose. See the example below, in which objects are aligned, oriented, and size-standardized to allow readers to compare various poisonous scorpions.</p>

<figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure&nbsp;1: Poisonous scorpions, medical textbook ~200 AD, transcript ~500 AD. From: Alfred Stückelberger, Bild und Wort</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>For most of their time scientific drawings and copper plates intentionally showed “average” observations, not individual specimen. The drawings were in fact an overlay, idealized version of single animals and plants. They also came with key information: Maria Sibylla Merian and others who documented nature explained the <a href="../../posts/Image_how_scale/index.html">size of specimen</a> in their drawings and often included known insects that could double as scale information.</p>
</section>
<section id="photography" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="photography">Photography</h2>
<p>With the advent of photography, publications started to include photos and microscopic images of specimen. A pioneer of photographic images in biology and medicine was the physiologist Marey. Étienne-Jules Marey, a French physiologist, developed many medical apparatuses, and notably the first “chronophotographic gun” in 1882 which allowed him to capture twelve frames per second on the same picture to document the rapid movements of animal and human locomotion. Notably, Marey also authored the first text book of data visualizing for physiology, introducing many scientists to charts and how to use photo images as evidence in biomedicine. The book, La Méthode graphique dans les sciences expérimentales can be viewed online in French (Text on line) and was <a href="https://medium.com/nightingale/information-graphic-visionaries-6dda1a0b8056">recently translated by George Hattab and RJ Andrews</a>.</p>

<figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure&nbsp;2: Marey invented a method to study locomotion with photography</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>At the turn of the last century, the first photographs appeared in scientific journals and slowly photos were used to document biological observations made through the microscope, e.g.&nbsp;Newth’s microscopic image of lamprey’s larvae. At the same time, Friedrich Kopsch in Berlin captured serial time-lapse images to document gastrulation in axolotl and frog eggs.</p>

</div>
<p>Image in scientific publications however were not always well received – in a letter to the editor, Benjamin Moore complained in 1910 that:</p>

<figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure&nbsp;4: Letter to the Editor, Nature</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The invention of fluorescent markers and techniques to couple these to antibodies by Albert Coons made light microscopy a mainstream technique widely accepted and images became accepted as data also outside its core application fields, embryology and morphology. With the invention of photography, and in particular digital photo-micrography, a steady increase in images figures is noticeable in scientific articles. Today <a href="../../posts/Image_numbers/index.html">20% of the articles indexed in PubMed</a> contain image figures and in the minutes you spend reading this article, 5 new publications with images will appear.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cheat-sheets-for-image-publishing">Cheat sheets for Image publishing</h2>
<p>Images, initially drawings now photos, are <a href="../../posts/Image_history/index.html">widely used in biology and medicine</a> but when published <a href="../../posts/Image_numbers/index.html">not always understandable</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="image-workflow-for-novice-users" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="image-workflow-for-novice-users">Image Workflow for Novice Users</h2>
<p>When preparing images for publication, the sequence and proper use of software matters to truthfully report observations. During the first lock down, Christopher Schmied and I therefore created cheat sheets that explain a most basic workflow to get everyone from microscope data to figure in a few simple steps.</p>
</section>
<section id="cheat-sheets" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cheat-sheets">Cheat Sheets</h2>
<p>The workflow is summarized in two printable cheat sheets. One cheat sheet explains the steps towards a publishable image, the second cheat sheet how to implement the steps with ImageJ/FIJI image processing software.</p>

<p>Beyond our starter cheat sheets more great resources help you along the way: The “Biologist’s guide to planning and performing quantitative bioimaging experiments” describes the entire arc from sample to microscope via image analysis towards data interpretation and publication. The resource lists many key points and aggregates links to more detailed descriptions, making it easy for biologists to navigate their first microscopy experiments.</p>

<section id="how-to-image-availability" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-to-image-availability">How to… image availability</h2>
<p>I <a href="../../posts/Image_how_mag/index.html">said this before</a>, but it should be said again: Make a copy of your original microscope/image file before starting any processing and adjustments and then store this image file along with the final, processed image somewhere save. In an ideal world your colleagues should see your final published image figure and be able to re-do the analysis to get there from a provided microscope image. Ideally, nobody would need to ask you, i.e., the files (TIFFimage, PNG image, scripts, method, anaylsis pipeline etc) should be in a public repository. At present, finding authors and working email adresses is a lot of detective work with changing affiliation, Email, or even profession. This was “wonderfully” demonstrated recently. Researchers investigated how well “data available upon request” really works. To no ones surprise and in almost 50%, this did not even got an Email replies. The team then made “rigorous attempts to contact the authors”, i.e.&nbsp;continuously bothered the authors, which increased the data availability a little, but not enough (Tedersoo et al., 2021).</p>
</section>
<section id="public-places-for-your-data" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="public-places-for-your-data">Public places for your data</h2>
<p>For regular light microscope image techniques many public storage possibilities exist and should be used. Free options for up to 20-50Gb of image data are <a href="https://zenodo.org/">Zenodo</a>, <a href="https://osf.io/">Open Science Framework</a>, and <a href="https://figshare.com/">Figshare</a>. These repositories are broad and allow upload of any kind of digital data. A dedicated option for image data are <a href="https://www.openmicroscopy.org/omero/institution/">OMERO servers</a>, however these are usually maintained by institutions, rarely by individual labs and can be both public or private. Image data repositories, that are fully searchable are still being build. The <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/bioimage-archive/">BioImage Archive</a> is one such attempt that accepts any image data, the Image Data Resource publishes image datasets that serves as reference datasets, and EMPIAR is a resource specifically for Electron Microscopy data.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="which-files-should-be-deposited">Which files should be deposited?</h2>
<p>The specific file type of the microscope image will depend on imaging setup. A standard format for loss-loss compression is TIFF or the open format OME-TIFF. In specialized microscopy techniques that rapidly accumulate tera-bites of data, e.g., long-term live-imaging, light-sheet microscopy, or similar the original microscopy files are often not stored locally and too large for public repositories. When only compressed files can be kept, PNG files are preferred to e.g., JPEG files, as they allow loss-less compression.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-to-image-colors">How to… image colors</h2>
<p>Images come in many appearances. Photos, histology staining, and some clinical image are usually not color adjusted and shown in full color. Electron microscopy images show one layer of information and are shown in greyscale. In light microscopy images we can excite features in several different wavelengths and combine them in multi-colored images. And this is where trouble starts (more on trouble <a href="../../posts/Image_numbers/index.html">in my overview</a>. I already wrote about <a href="../../posts/Image_how_annot/index.html">color annotation</a>, today I focus on the image colors.</p>
</section>
<section id="adjust-brightness-contrast" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="adjust-brightness-contrast">Adjust brightness &amp; contrast</h2>
<p>For each channel, brightness and contrast can be adjusted separately. When images are to be compared, fixed intensity values should be used. Adjustment can be done in linear mode, which is applied uniformly to the whole image [note: if you are really into image display details there is much more to learn for you here, monitor display are not uniform, different algorithms are “linear” in different ways etc. If this is critical for your image analysis, learn more. If not, stop here and move on with your science].</p>

<section id="select-color-display" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="select-color-display">Select color display</h2>
<p>The vast majority of light microscope cameras capture each emission spectrum as a separate greyscale image. Users then often select a display color (‘lookup table’) for each channel. Many times users simply pick the color of the emission wavelengths. DAPI peaks at 461 nm and is then shown in blue, GFP peaks at 509 nm, which is in the green portion of the visible spectrum, and RFP peaks at 583 nm,hence is shown as red.</p>
<section id="visibiilty-of-colors" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="visibiilty-of-colors">Visibiilty of colors</h4>
<p>The problem is that blue or red on the black background of microscopy images have a much lower visibility than the original greyscale image. We can see much more fine details when the signal is shown in white on black, as in the original greyscale image. You thus serve your audiences best if you show microscope images in greyscale also in your figures</p>

<section id="accessibility-of-colors" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="accessibility-of-colors">Accessibility of colors</h4>
<p>When we prepare figures we should also consider color-blind audiences. Problems to differentiate red/green, as is the case in deuteranopia, is well known, but also other combinations may be problematic. Online software and also ImageJ allow you to test color combinations for their visibility to diverse audiences. In general: you may find possibilities to combine two channels in color-blind save mode. It is however impossible to find color options for three or more channels. Thus your safest option is again to show each color channel with a separate greyscale image.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-are-we-still-debating-color-choices">Why are we still debating color choices?</h2>
<p>In all forms of science communication, including image preparation, authors should be considered of colorblind readers. Among data scientists, it is well established for at least over a century that red and green colors should not be used in parallel when communicating data.</p>
<p>W.C. Brinton already wrote about this topic in his books in 1914 and 1939 (Chapter 49 “Color and its use”), citing an even older article by Edward Ayers from 1907, that “One man in twenty and one women in about two hundred are unable to see red and green normally” (Brintons book is <a href="https://archive.org/details/graphicpresentat00brinrich/mode/1up">available online</a>).</p>
<p>Surprisingly, being considerate with color choices still not reached all: a widely shared technology feature in Nature (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-021-02696-z">Katsnelson, 2021, Colour me better: fixing figures for colour blindness</a>) again calls for authors to use inclusive colors. Also this is echoed by many scientific societies e.g., <a href="https://www.ascb.org/science-news/how-to-make-scientific-figures-accessible-to-readers-with-color-blindness/">the American Society for Cell Biology</a>.</p>

<section id="more-on-color-combinations" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="more-on-color-combinations">More on color combinations</h2>
<p>How exactly colors can be combined and still be accessible to all readers is controversial. For some images, such as colored photographs, rendering them safe for viewing by colorblind readers is not possible and risks sacrificing clarity. But, as pointed out above, adjusting the display colors is simple for most light microscopy images. Here, colors are selected in the microscope or image processing software. Many already offer combinations of color that are accessible to most colorblind audiences. Currently, many scientists already embraced green/magenta as a color scheme to replace green/red images. However, this may pose a semantic problem, when referring to red-fluorophores depicted in magenta color etc, or a convention problem to others, who feel “Green Fluorescent Protein” should not be shown in e.g., cyan. In light of these semantic and convention obstacles, scientists should embrace publishing each channel of a multicolored light microscope image as a standalone, separate (greyscale) image. Grayscale images are in any case superior to discern fine image details such as specific structures or cells in images. Human eyes perceive the contrast between light and dark areas more easily than they do contrast between a color and dark areas, e.g.&nbsp;as is the case when showing intensities in green on a dark background.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="color-annotations">Color annotations</h2>
<p>Image colors are usually annotated in the color they are shown, this is fast and easy for readers. Problems may arise when image colors are not color-bind save, when the image has yellow stainigs that do not work for text. Alternatively, the color name is written out and linked to the molecule (GFP = green, actin-Cy3 = red etc). In this case the readers has to do a semantic translation of color name to image color, which is slow and error-prone as we all see colors differently.</p>
<p>Whenever you have &gt;2-3 colors, you can safely assume that not all will be able to distinguish them any more. Not everyone is familiar with “lavender” or “salmon”, as we know since the hilarious and VERY <a href="https://blog.xkcd.com/2010/05/03/color-survey-results/">exhaustive survey by XKCD</a>.</p>

<p>Oftentimes lines, arrows, symbols and regions of interest (ROIs) are used to point out important details or areas in an image. It is essential that all annotations are distinguishable and clearly explained. Avoid using the same symbol for several meanings: if arrows are used to point out structures, they should not concurrently be used to also indicate motion.</p>

<p>Figure legends are essential for complete image annotation. They should inform about the specimen, maybe preparation, dyes and all essentials for understanding the image. Which information is in the figure versus the figure legend (and method section) depends on journal requirements and personal preference, but in sum the information should make the figure self-explanatory. A critical analysis by Yu of figure legends showed that up to 70% of the information needed to comprehend the figure was lacking, many times readers needed a complete paper to fully comprehend figures.</p>

<p>Microscopy images without any annotations are abstract art rather than scientific evidences. <a href="../../posts/Image_how_mag/index.html">After deciding on image size and format</a>, the next step towards making image content understandable is to annotate the object size, explain all colors, and any symbols used.</p>

<p>Every scientific image needs scale information to allow audiences to compare and relate the image size with the physical world <a href="../../posts/Image_numbers/index.html">and not all published images currently have scale info</a>. Scale information is best conveyed with a scale bar with its physical dimensions.

<p>Scales are included in scientific illustrations for a long time in different ways. In Maria Merian times, size statements were included in the book, not the drawing itself; she usually stated in the preface that all drawings are at real scale.</p>

<p>Using familiar objects for scale isn’t possible when we make microscopic observations. This may be why in the earliest published photographs and microscope pictures (mind you, there aren’t many as images were considered a waste of space and decorational) scales are omitted.</p>
<p>A lovely tool that tried placing familiar objects next to microscopic scenes is the Utah genetics cellular scale animation <a href="http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/cells/scale/">Genetics Utah Animation of Scale</a> I never cease to be amazed at the relative size differences of cells and how they vary over so many magnitudes!</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="suggestions-for-making-scale-bars">Suggestions for making scale bars</h2>
<p>As we don’t have a clear mental image of the size of a salt grain, sesames seed, or submicron cats to reliably use them to scale, we have to for now rely on scale bars. Using ImageJ/FIJI this can be rapidly accomplished: when using Bioformats to import microscopy files, the metadata, including the physical size, is read in. Then use Analyze &gt; Tools &gt; Scale Bar to define length, width, color, position, and label or your scale bar.</p>
<section id="length" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="length">Length</h5>
<p>Be kind to your audience and use simple units, such as 100um, 50um, 10 or 2um.</p>
</section>
<section id="color" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="color">Color</h5>
<p>Scale bars should have a high contrast with the background. Avoid red, green, or blue bars, as these colors might be considered part of the image.</p>
</section>
<section id="position" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="position">Position</h5>
<p>Lower left corner is a safe place. The upper space should be kept for important information like species, cell type, or gene name, and many times figure panel name (A, B,…).</p>
</section>
<section id="add-scale-bar-last" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="add-scale-bar-last">Add scale bar last</h5>
<p>In the process of writing your manuscript you may re-think the figure size. Also images are re-sized for posters and slides. It is therefore easiest to add only a very fine scale bar with FIJI and then re-draw it in Adobe Illustrator (or PowerPoint, as I now that about half of you out there use PowerPoint for making figures and posters!).</p>

<section id="how-to-image-formatting" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-to-image-formatting">How to… image formatting</h2>
<p>In my <a href="../../posts/Image_numbers/index.html">previous post</a> I wrote about issues that make images in publications hard to understand. Now let’s improve this!</p>
<section id="before-you-start" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="before-you-start">Before you start…</h4>
<p>At best do not mess with the image from your microscope (usually .TIFF).Before adjusting an image for publication, first make a copy and keep the original untouched somewhere save. You more likely than not will need it at some point, e.g.&nbsp;to re-do analysis with newer software, make a better version for publication, or to give to colleagues for reanalysis!</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="adjust-brighness-and-orientation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="adjust-brighness-and-orientation">Adjust brighness and orientation</h2>
<p>Almost always adjustments are necessary in digital images, most common of the brightness and contrast. When doing quantitative comparisons of images, fixed intensity values should be used and novice users should only apply linear adjustments that are applied to the whole image. Important: make these adjustments before cropping an image! Miura and Norrelykke in detail describe how the same adjustment calculation varies when performed on an full-view versus a cropped image. Next, many images are rotated. There are consensus ways to orient images in many fields. Humans are shown with the head at the top and the feet at the bottom, but also other traditions exist, e.g.&nbsp;for epithelia the apical side in shown at the top etc. This often requires rotation of microscope images. All rotations must be done carefully as this process redistributes image intensity values. In most software, increments of 90 degrees pixels can be reordered rather than interpolated, which maintains the intensity distribution. (Find out more here: Miura &amp; Norrelykke 2021, Schmied &amp; Jambor, 2020).</p>

</section>
<section id="cropping-magnification" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cropping-magnification">Cropping &amp; Magnification</h2>
<p>Cropping is a normal adjustment to focus the audience on the key message. To show cellular structures, a close up of the organelle is required, not the whole slide that was imaged. As a rule, cropping is permitted, as long as no key feature is removed that is important for the scientific conclusion. Scientist should also consider the size of the image in the final figure: are the features that matter visible? Might it be better to show the image in larger size? Alternatively, consider enlarging and cropping the image to focus the reader on your key result, or ideally show the original image and an image detail (inset) side by side. When insets are shown their position in the original image must be indicated, e.g., with a “Region of interest”.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="assembling-a-figure-with-images">Assembling a figure with images</h2>
<p>Finally, when images are all processed there are many solutions to assembling multi-panel figures. Usually, figures do not only show one microscope image, but several views, split channels, merged images, or false-color quantifications. One is <a href="https://imagej.net/plugins/figurej">FigureJ</a>, a plugin for ImageJ/FIJI by Jerome Mutterer. Another possibility is QuickFigures, again for ImageJ by Mazo. And last, it is also possible to run image processing scripts in the vector graphics software Inkscape directly (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlnZMybf7g">here</a> is a youtube tutorial by Jerome Mutterer).</p>

<p>500 papers are newly indexed in PubMed every day, almost 1 million each year (<a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/index_stats_comp.html">PubMed Statistics</a>). Many of these contain images: 20% have a photos, light or electron microscopy images, x-rays or similar (see <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7888968">Lee, 2018</a>). These images document the appearance or structure of specimen, tissues, or cells, and are a analysed to gain quantitative insights of biological processes.</p>

<section id="what-we-did" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-we-did">What we did</h2>
<p>Not too long ago a motivated group of scientists including me systematically analyzed the clarity and legibility of images (<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001161">Jambor et al., 2021</a>). It turns out, in only a fraction of the publications, 10-20%, images are fully accessible and interpretable. To get to this number, we surveyed the image quality in the top journals, based on impact factor, in three representative fields, physiology, cell biology and plant sciences. We used a validated protocol and each article was assessed by two independent reviewers. The screening protocol covered diverse aspects: the image presentation in the figure, the completeness of feature annotations, presence of scale information, accessible image colors, and informative image titles/legends.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="scale-information-missing-in-up-to-70-of-papers">Scale information: missing in up to 70% of papers</h4>
<p>This is possibly the most unexpected finding: many images in publications lack sufficient information about physical scales. This is unexpected as each of us had some memories of being taught about scale bars early in our careers, if not already in high-school biology. Scale information can come in many forms and all of them were acceptable to us: as scale bar inside the image, as information about the physical size of the entire image in figures, and even an indication of the magnification were deemed acceptable. This however was entirely missing in 10-30% of the papers and incomplete in another 30-40%.</p>

<p>Red/Green color blindness affects around 10% of the male population, and less than 1% of the female population. Nonetheless, astonishingly 30 - 50% of the screened images were not color blind friendly! In addition, in around 20% of images the annotations of colors were not color blind save. This means that colorblind readers are hindered in seeing or fully understand the key scientific messages conveyed in these images.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="details-not-visible-or-insets-not-explained">Details: not visible, or insets not explained</h4>
<p>Just like in photography, also in microscopy the key subject should ideally fill the frame. What does this mean? If you want to show a cellular detail, do not show the entire petri dish of cells – cutting unnecessary image details is allowed, if this does not change the conclusion! Likewise, if you aim to show morphology of an organ, make sure that said organ is fully visible – image stitching, if declared (legend, methods), is possible and allowed. Many times an overview, e.g.&nbsp;of cell culture dish and a focus on some detail is shown with two images side by side, one the original image and alongside this a zoomed inset. In one third of publications, likely accidental, the origin of the inset in the original image is not clearly indicated or entirely missing. This hinders the audiences to understand the relation of inset to image, especially since in half of the cases the inset is also not explained in the legend.</p>

<p>Speaking of annotations – they are not optional, despite what the data suggest: up to 30% of publications omit an explanation of the colors shown in images (e.g., channel, staining), up to 40% fail to explain symbols, regions of interest, or arrows, and many times the species or cell type visible in the image is not clear from the legend. Especially all colors and symbols must essentially be explained with the figure, while further details such as specimen could also be described in the method section – alas, it is also missing very often in this section, but that is another story (Marques G, 2020; Sheen et al., 2019).</p>

<p>We showed that across all criteria, only 1/5 th of publications with images show fully interpretable images. Beyond our analysis, many papers also fail to understandably present data on image acquisition, imaging methods and also image processing details. We as scientific community have to ensure that our scientific data is truthful and reliable, and also understandable to current and future readers. Incomprehensible images limit effective science communication and we should strive to improve all data we present in publications.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-to-graphical-abstacts-3">How to… Graphical Abstacts 3</h2>
<p>I described tools and icon resources in <a href="../../posts/GraphicalAbstract_1/index.html">Graphical Abstracts 1</a> and how to organise the page for a legible graphical abstract in <a href="../../posts/GraphicalAbstracts_2/index.html">Graphical Abstracts 2</a>. Now, as the last step, we can add a little text where necessary, quicker orient readers with colors, and make sure we got it right with a little feedback.</p>
<section id="text" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="text">Text</h4>
<p>A minimum amount of text will be necessary in almost all Graphical Abstracts: to explain arrows, images, and point to conclusions. Of course, keep text to a minimum and understandable, i.e., without jargon or abbreviations. Use easy to understand language: you may want to use popular keywords or phrases to rapidly grab attention and orient audiences. Text may have to be added to label pictograms that are otherwise ambiguous or that are uncommon. A circle could mean molecule, area, cell or similar. <img src="https://helenajamborwrites.netlify.app/posts/GraphicalAbstracts_3/text1.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Pictograms with unclear meaning"></p>

<figcaption class="figure-caption">Pictograms explained with minimal text</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>When no images are available, e.g., for highly specialized words, text can be used as a substitute for images.</p>
<p>Think of all text as legends to your visuals! In this spirit, try to encode your text annotations the same way as the visual element they are encoding.</p>

<section id="colors" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="colors">Colors</h4>
<p>We first and foremost make graphical abstracts as a visual appetizer for our readers, and as such they should be attractive and colorful. In all visualizations we use color to highlight or contrast (see also examples with text above), to depict the natural appearance of a visualized object, or to encode numbers: sequential/continuous data should be encoded with varying saturation of one color, diverging data with a 2-color scheme, and qualitative data may be encoded with varying color hues</p>

</div>
<section id="consistent-colors" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="consistent-colors">Consistent colors</h5>
<p>In all cases it is important to use colors consistently. The color code/color scheme should be maintained within the abstract and also between abstract and the main manuscript. A change in color is considered to also be a change in meaning – colors should therefore be carefully chosen. As colors are perceived immediately, they should overall be used sparsely to not overload readers and distract from the main message.</p>
</section>
<section id="accessible-colors" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="accessible-colors">Accessible colors</h5>
<p>When selecting colors, authors should always ensure that colors are accessible to all readers, including color blind audiences. We included many color suggestions in <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001161">our big survey of image figures published in PLOS Bio</a>: <img src="https://helenajamborwrites.netlify.app/posts/GraphicalAbstracts_3/ColorVisibility.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Color visibilities on backdrop"></p>

<p>And, the importance of making all your figure accessible to color biond was was prominently highlighted in a technology feature by Alla Katsnelson in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02696-z">Nature</a>, featuring also my humble opinion.</p>

  <title>How to… Graphical abstracts 2: Layout and arrows</title>

<section id="how-to-graphical-abstacts-2" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-to-graphical-abstacts-2">How to… Graphical Abstacts 2</h2>
<p>In <a href="../../posts/GraphicalAbstract_1/index.html">Graphical Abstracts 1</a> I outlined where you can find tools, icons, pictograms and simple charts for you Graphical Abstracts. In the next step, the visuals need to be organised into a logical sequence. You therefore need to know your page dimension, decide on a reading direction, and then support the chosen layout with arrows. And at the very end, you can add a little text and colors <a href="../../posts/GraphicalAbstracts_3/GraphicalAbstracts.html">Graphical Abstracts 3</a></p>
<section id="page-dimension" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="page-dimension">Page dimension</h4>
<p>Layout is defined as the arrangement of parts on an area. What area can you fill? Many times journals request Graphical Abstracts as squares as they are used as thumbnail preview for your article. See for example the landing page of Current Biology: <img src="https://helenajamborwrites.netlify.app/posts/GraphicalAbstracts_2/CurrentBio.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Note that the image is roughly stamp-size and that the best graphical abstracts should work in this size. When your graphical abstract is a full figure for a paper, poster, or grant, you usually aim for a rectangle-landscape area: this fits much better onto a page and it is also easier to design a reading direction for rectangles. Especially when your space is limited, such as in grant application,s make use of the full-line width to not waste any precious space!</p>

</div>
</section>
<section id="reading-direction" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reading-direction">Reading direction</h4>
<p>When designing a graphical abstract you have to clearly tell your audiences where they should start reading. We read text and also all visuals from left to right, unless prompted otherwise by color, arreows, size of image etc.<br>
Which reading direction you chose depends on your message: if you talk about a linear processes with clear beginning and end, an organization from left to right is suitable as time is usually shown this way (e.g., as x-axis in line charts). Linear processes could be workflows or experimental pipelines, but also cellular processes such as embryo development, cell differentiation, or disease progression. If you instead talk about cyclic events, such as daily or annual recurrences, metabolic cycles, or also cell division, consider using a circular layout. If you just want to make a comparison, before after, on or off, scenario and Zoomed in view, etc, consider a parallel or nested organization.</p>

<section id="arrows-connect-the-visuals" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="arrows-connect-the-visuals">Arrows connect the visuals</h4>
<p>Arrows are omnipresent in all explanatory figures. They connect text, pictograms, images, or charts into a sequential narrative or “storyline”. Arrows come in many designs, just arrowheads, lines with a rounded tip or numerous other end-marks, and of course also lines without any marks can be used to guide the view. Depending on the arrow design, it can adopt many different functions: arrows can simply reinforce the layout, or they can highlight an exception from a reading direction. But arrows can also point to strucures or regions, label, indicate movement, or time. An upward arrow for example could mean ‘move up’, ‘increase’ or ‘good’, while a circular arrow could be day, year or life cycle. In addition, many many domains specific meanings exist, e.g.&nbsp;a cornered arrow for transcription start sites in molecular genetics. Importantly, the semantic meaning of an arrow is highly depended on the context in which it is presented. In graphical abstracts we should decide on one meaning for our arrows, and refrain from varying this. When two arrow types are combined in one graphical abstract thy should be visually cleraly distinct and may have to be explicit explained to readers.</p>

<section id="how-to-graphical-abstracts-1" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-to-graphical-abstracts-1">How to… Graphical abstracts 1</h2>
<p>Graphical abstracts are increasingly common to explain biomedical concepts and research results. As “summary slides”, they have long been used at the end of a talk or lecture. Today, graphical abstracts are widely used as a thumbnail/preview of online publications and also found at posters, on lab websites, and in research grant applications. The key element of every graphical abstract are the visuals - pictograms, icons, or images. Text, arrows and lines then combine the visual elements into a narrated story, and color highlights key elements or encodes quantities. I summarized a few key points to consider before designing a graphical abstract.</p>

<section id="key-visual-find-icons-and-pictograms" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="key-visual-find-icons-and-pictograms">Key visual: find icons and pictograms</h4>
<p>All graphical abstract have key visuals and usually these are icons, pictograms or symbols, less common are iconic microscope or photographic pics or charts. Pictograms can be illustrations, constructed from simple shapes, but mostly are found in icon libraries. Many icon libraries are free and some can also be used without attribution (public domain). In libraries, icons can be downloaded as <strong>PNG</strong> or <strong>SVG</strong> file. PNG, Portable Network Graphic, is a raster-graphics format for lossless data compression. PNGs are ready to use on the web or in software, but are not adaptable. SVG, Scalable Vector Graphic, is a vector images format that can be used interactively on the web, adapted with graphic software, and also used as image as is. Best: you can scale it as large as you like and no pixels will appear. Yay for large posters!</p>

</ul>
<p>When selecting icons for a graphical abstract make sure all icons have an overall similar appearance: same line-width, colors, and level of detail. Many times icon libraries have a design team to ensure this, but open libraries collect pictograms from various designers with quite distinct appearance. When you want to adapt icons to match in style, get the SVG file which is adaptable with e.g., Inkscape or Illustrator.</p>

<section id="key-visual-data-in-chart" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="key-visual-data-in-chart">Key visual: data in chart</h4>
<p>When a key visual should show data in the form of a chart, it is advisable to stick to the most common chart types, bar, line, pie chart or scatter plots. Most readers are familiar with these and they are founded on our core visual perception abilities, comparing lengths, angles, or slopes. For all charts ensure that only a few categories or data points are included and details, tick marks, axis label, legends, are omitted.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<figcaption class="figure-caption">Simple Charts that may be used in Graphical Abstracts</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Complex charts should only be used if they have e.g.&nbsp;iconic status to indicate a specific method was used: in life sciences t-SNE often symbolize single cell data was obtained, and red/green heatmaps indicate microarray data.</p>
<p>A good overview of chart types and their use is summarized in data viz catalogues (e.g., <a href="https://datavizcatalogue.com/>DataVizCatalogue">The Data Visualisation Catalogue</a>)</p>
</section>
<section id="tools" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tools">Tools</h4>
<p>Graphical abstracts can be prepared with the same software also used for posters and figures. Many of you will use PoswerPoint. Suitable vector-design software are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adobe Illustrator (commercial)</li>
<li>CorelDraw (commercial)</li>
<li>Affinity Designer (commercial)</li>
<li>open-source: <a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a> - this sweet readers, has direct link to many icon libraries (newest version)! Go to File &gt; Import Web Image &gt; select library.</li>
</ul>
<p>Vector-based graphics programs allow zooming in and out without quality loss. For most graphical abstracts PowerPoint will also produce sufficient results when slides are adjusted in size and exported as vector graphics, e.g., as PDF. To prevent pixelation select that images are not compressed in the options. A big plus of the open source Inkscape: it keeps getting better. Newest feature: direct import of icons from web-based icon libraries via “Import Web Image” tab. This works already for Bioicons and Reactome via dropdown. Also possible in Inkscaoe: script-based image processing, and script-based chart preparation. Another plus, Inkscape relies on the web vector format SVG and is thus readable by browsers and other vector graphics programs.</p>
</section>
<section id="web-based-tools" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="web-based-tools">Web-based tools</h4>
<p>A popular, however increasingly costly option are <a href="https://www.biorender.com/">Biorender</a> and <a href="https://mindthegraph.com/">MindtheGraph</a>, that have annual subscription plans. Biorender has many sample templates for a quick start and vast icons for life sciences, but you must regularly check the licenses as they are constantly adapted. As of now the <strong>first</strong> author must hold a premium license to publish their figures – which is tricky for labs as first author usually does not make all figures, or when authors leave lab etc. Mindthegraph has a similar offer, and also provides design consulting.</p>
</section>
<section id="key-message" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="key-message">Key message</h4>
<p>Before starting the design process, spend a good amount of time brainstorming the key message you want to get across. I personally do this by doodling on paper and discussing with peers. Without a clear main message, it will be impossible to design a good graphical abstract. These days a quick conversation with ChatGPT may also help to towards summarizing an abstract to a punchy one-to-two sentences condensed version.</p>

<p>I personally was looking for an excuse to get back to making charts with R. All I could think of at the time was however the war in Ukraine. My granddad Anton Jámbor was born and raised in Khust, Zakarpatia Oblast, which was another reason to finally educate myself about Ukraine. So, I made a plan and almost completed it! I researched the people and population of Ukraine, the country and cities, and a little bit the health data since my day-job is in medical research at the University hospital.</p>
<p>From idea to implementation:</p>

<p>Over the course of April I completed 18 of the 30 challenges. Many times I made several solutions and tested many more. Below is the example for Kazimir Malevich. I plotted the color-schemes he used in his paintings over his lifetime and tried our several options, including an animation.</p>
<p>Kazimir Malevich was born in Ukraine and is famous for monochrome,abstract paintings. However, that was a brief period, before and after his paintings are full of colors! I analyzed his color-usage over his lifetime. This was one of the few datasets I created myself. <img src="https://helenajamborwrites.netlify.app/posts/30DayChartChallenge/helenajambor_day10.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Malevich colors {colors in Malevich life time as bar charts}"> <em>Malevich’s colors from early to late periods as bar charts</em></p>

<p>Finding time each day for a full month was impossible with Easter vacation and care work requiting my attention. Now, in a calm summer, I finally completed five more challenges for which I had already found data. I posted these final entries on Ukraine’s Independence Day, coinciding with 6 months since the war starts.</p>

<p>My goal was to create a visually and thematically cohesive work. I plan to use my charts for teaching purposes and for teaching the many ways how we can communicate data with charts. Most of my time, as always, was spend on finding a topic for which a dataset was available. A lot of time was also consumed by data wrangling and getting it in a format to actually make charts. And only a fleeting moment for creating the visualizations. That’s how it goes!</p>
<p>Enjoy my charts, <strong>Slava Ukraini</strong> and keep Ukraine in the news!</p>
