### Excited about nucleic acids 
I studied biology in Berlin and at Robinson College/Cambridge, and did my Diploma at the Max-Planck for Molecular Genetics where I investigated cycling RNA expressions which control the number of vertebrae in higher animals. 

### PhD at EMBL
I completed my PhD work at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory/Heidelberg with Anne Ephrussi. We investigated ribonucleic acid motifs important for cellular organisation and body axis formation. I described one element that controls the subcellular localization and works in any RNA and any cell type we tested! 

### Large data and needing to visualise
With Pavel Tomancak at the Max-Planck Institute for Cell Biology and Genetics I then did a genome-scale investigation of all 14,000 types of RNA a fruit fly can make and showed their changing subcellular localization in development. The data is collected in the Dresden Ovary Table (DOT) and publicly available.

### Data vis for life sciences
After completing my time in the laboratory, I was project managing Spim4You, a spin-off idea for imaging software consulting, did a sabbatical as a Fellow at the Wissenschaftskolleg Berlin, and now research how data visualizations can help to communicate biomedical data.
