## How to… image scale information
Microscopy images without any annotations are abstract art rather than scientific evidences. A first step towards making image content understandable is to annotate the object size, explain all colors, and any symbols used. [see How to...image annotation]

## How to… Scale
Every scientific image needs scale information to allow audiences to compare and relate the image size with the physical world. Scale information is best conveyed with a scale bar with its dimensions. It’s also possible to make statements about the size of the entire image, or, as last resort, state the dimensions in the figure legend.

## Many ways to show scale in images
Scales are included in scientific illustrations for a long time in different ways. I recently saw drawings by Maria Sybilla Merian at Kupferstichkabinett Berlin and the Library Dresden. Merian, who lived from 1647 to 1717, is renowned for her exceptional illustrations of biological specimens and gained recognition as a scientist for her nature observations, for example, of insect metamorphosis. Merian took care of size statements with her actual drawings, as she stated in the preface of her books that all drawings are to scale. So for her drawings the size of the original book page will allow you to assess the specimen size.

A long tradition is to include familiar objects in drawings or images for scale: a penny is placed on a rock, a person stands next to a tree, or a measuring tape is shown – and these measure are still used today.

Using familiar objects for scale isn’t possible when we make microscopic observations. In the few early photographs and micrographs that got published (images were often considered a waste of space and decoration, see figure), scales were often omitted. 

A lovely tool that tried placing familiar objects next to microscopic scenes is the Utah genetics cellular scale animation <a href="http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/cells/scale/">Genetics Utah Animation of Scale</a> I never cease to be amazed at the relative size differences of cells and how they vary over so many magnitudes! A fun, although not quite practical idea is suggested by Monica Zoppe, cats for scale! Check out <a href="http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v14/n7/abs/nmeth.4300.html"> her article!</a>

## 3 suggestions for scale bars
As we don’t have a clear mental image of the size of a salt grain, sesames seed, or submicron cats to reliably use them to scale, we have to for now rely on scale bars.
Using ImageJ/FIJI this can be rapidly accomplished: when using Bioformats to import microscopy files, the metadata, including the physical size, is read in. Then use Analyze > Tools > Scale Bar to define length, width, color, position, and label or your scale bar. 

<ul>
  <li><strong>Length: </strong>Be kind to your audience and use simple units, such as 100um, 50um, 10 or 2um.</li>
  <li><strong>Color:</strong> Scale bars should have a high contrast with the background. Avoid red, green, or blue bars, as these colors might be considered part of the image.</li>
  <li><strong>Position</strong>: Lower left corner is a safe place. The upper space should be kept for important information like species, cell type, or gene name, and many times figure panel name (A, B,…).</li>
  <li><strong>Add scale bar last</strong>: In the process of writing your manuscript you may re-think the figure size. Also images are re-sized for posters and slides. It is therefore easiest to add only a very fine scale bar with FIJI and then re-draw it in Adobe Illustrator (or PowerPoint, as I now that about half of you out there use PowerPoint for making figures and posters!).</li>
</ul>

PS if you find old scientific images with scale bars, or interesting scales, send them my way for my collection!
