#### All the useful websites! 
I have already emailed these Dataviz resources to countless scientists - high time to finally set up a centralised collection of to all websites!

The links are organised by the different aspects of creating scientific data figures: 1. Choosing a chart, 2. text, 3. layouts, 4. colours. There are also links to special use cases and a bit of entertainment. 

#### Choosing charts
