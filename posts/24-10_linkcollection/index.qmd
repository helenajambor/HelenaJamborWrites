#### All the useful websites! 
I have already emailed these Dataviz resources to countless scientists - high time to post the collected links here!

The websites are organised by the different aspects of creating scientific data figures: 1. Choosing a chart, 2. text, 3. layouts, 4. colors. There are also links to special use cases and a bit of entertainment. 

#### Choosing charts
- [Severino Ribecca DataViz Catalogue](http://www.datavizcatalogue.com/)
- [Yan Holz Python Graph Gallery](https://python-graph-gallery.com/) - also available for R! 
- [Ferdio's illustrated guide](http://datavizproject.com/)

Further reading: [Beyond bar and line plots](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002128)

#### Text (replace text with images)
- Use abbreviations rarely, and only if tested.
- Add alt-text to support accessibility of figures. [Here is how](https://www.perkins.org/resource/how-write-alt-text-and-image-descriptions-visually-impaired/)
- Consider replacing/enhancing text with icons.
