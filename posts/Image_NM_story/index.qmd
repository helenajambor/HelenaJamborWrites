Our guidelines for image and image analyses publishing just got published for you all <a href=”LINK”> in Nature Methods</a>. For me personally, this was a very long time in the making, read how it came about!

## Some images, oh my!
I was prepping one of my data vis courses for scientist, which also covers preparing image figures. For a course in 2017 I was searching some teaching examples in publications when I realised that many, many authors were still happily using red/green color combinations in both charts and also in microscopy images, rendering their science visually inaccessible to colour-blind readers <a href="https://thenode.biologists.com/color-blind-audiences/photo/">(see my post at TheNode)</a>.

## We collected numbers, OH DEAR!
For the 2018 <a href=https://meetings.embo.org/event/18-lsm>Light Sheet Microscopy conference</a> many microscopy folks gathered in Dresden to discuss awesome images. Except me: still stunned by the subpar images in publications. At the conference I chatted with the Nature Methods editor Rita Strack how journals ensure image figures are legible (they did not then!) and my intention to survey this. This idea rapidly became a real project when I joined the eLIFE ambassadors and teamed up with Tracey Weissgerber, who had experience with meta-research (i.e.  screening literature). We then co-lead a dedicated ambassador group, analyzing tons of published images with a standardized protocol. This project really put numbers on what previously was just my impression: lots of pictures didn't have sizes marks, giving readers a little guessing game time. The colors? Turns out, many were like secret codes that only the authors could understand. Plus, the explanations often barely enlightened - check ourpaper <a href ="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001161">in PLOS BIO</a>

## Zoom, Zoom, Zoom: science in a global network
Our PLOS BIO paper got me onto the (virtual, remember COVID!) stage of the 2020 meeting of the German Bioimaging society. The Q&A was a lively discussion of many impossible ways to improve image communication and one clear idea: let's form a <a href="https://quarep.org/">QUAREP</a> working group for this! Starting with just four members, we hashed, clashed, and conjured what eventually became the checklists for image publishing. Quickly our <a href="https://quarep.org/working-groups/wg-12-image-visualization-and-analysis/">Working Group 12</a> grew and became very interdisciplinary: we have members from research institutes, medical clinics, and even NASA; from all continents and time-zones; from applied research, companies and  theory. Safe to say, we also at times failed to find a consensus and tip toed around some topics until we dropped them. Our opinions also differed on how strict we wanted to be with guidelines but also there found a workable compromise between our ideals and reality. In the end, all scientists globally, also those with little access to advanced microscopy facilities, should be empowered to reach the minimal goals, while at the same time we also wanted to push some higher image and image analysis standards. This lead to the the three levels, mandatory, recommended and ideal.

## A paper grows
Fuelled by caffeine and carbs at the Human Technopole in Milano, an intense writing weekend brought us the first manuscript draft. This was improved in feedback rounds with our QUAREP comrades and external voices. This extended vetting seems to have been a good idea: with just one round of small revisions our manuscript was accepted by our first choice journal, Nature Methods. And now we give the checklists to all of you scientists – These are not lists, but the audacious result of chasing pixel perfection in scientific zoom calls. For me personally it was a rewarding experience to collaborate with so many people, and from now I will keep meeting co-authors at many meetings to come!
