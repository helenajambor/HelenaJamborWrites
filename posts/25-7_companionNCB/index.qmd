## The whys - the science of what works for chart figures
My article on chart figures is out in [Nature Cell Biology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-025-01684-z). But, the preprint was of course longer. I had included the data and research we have on why each step of the checklist is important. That was cut from the final article, but I feel it is still nice to know for some of you. Therefore, here are the rationales, the reasons for what we do, the whys.

#### BASICS 
###### Choose chart
How charts work is an active area of research in computational sciences. For example, this revealed that humans excel at interpreting charts with a common scale, such as bar (x-axis) and scatter plots (x- and y-axis), but this task is harder with charts lacking a shared axis, like line and pie charts (Cleveland and McGill, 1984). And the task vary with chart type: line charts require comparison of direction and angle, maps and heat maps of color or texture, and treemaps and bubble charts of area (Cleveland and McGill, 1984); the success of the latter furthermore depends on the choose shape, with circles being harder to interpret than rectangles (Kong et al., 2010). Comparing trends across multiple pie charts is less effective than using a single bar or line chart (Hollands and Spence, 1992). Recent studies highlight challenges with bar charts that summarize distributions, as they obscure data transparency (Weissgerber et al., 2015). A great review of data visualization science is Franconeri et al., 2021.

###### Simplify charts
How much data is too much highly depends on the audience, thus generalizing studies are rare. Research however did show that increasingly dense versions of time course data remained legible even at reduced sizes (Heer et al., 2009). A recently widely shared chart, the climate stripes, even condenses a trend into merely colored stripes, retaining its information content 
(Hawkins, n.d.). Simplifying visual information, is a key recommendation from Edward Tufte, who introduced this strategy as “small multiples” (Tufte, 2011). Small multiples can be easily realized in programming software used for data visualization such as Python and R, where the feature is available as “gridding” and “faceting” respectively.

###### Text
Figures are most memorable when they integrate text with familiar keywords and phrases (Hegarty and Just, 1993; Martin, 2020). Comprehension is key, a study found that concise, jargon-free journal titles with minimal abbreviations correlate with higher citations (Letchford et al., 2015). Clarity/memorability can also be enhanced by supplementing text with icons or pictograms (Haroz et al., 2015).
Typography is crucial for legibility, though scientists are often limited publishers and institutional formatting guidelines. When choosing a font, ensure it is legible, with clear ascenders, descenders, and adequate white space (Wong, 2011a). A legible font features consistent letter height (x-height), clear ascenders (e.g., in "b") and descenders (e.g., in "p"), and sufficient white space within closed letters (e.g., "a" and "o"). There is no clear consensus on whether serif (e.g., Times New Roman) or sans serif (e.g., Arial) fonts are more readable (Arditi and Cho, 2005).

#### DESIGN
###### Layout
It is important to think how to arrange elements on a poster and a in multi-panel figures – this ensures readers see most important elements first. Similarly, arranging information efficiently in a chart is critical – a legend should be close to the item it explains, a a title should be findable. Further resources on how to organizing figure panels (Wong, 2011b, 2011c), graphical abstracts (Jambor and Bornhäuser, 2024) and posters (Brown, 1996; Faulkes, 2021; Jambor, 2023) is available, as well as tools that help authors quickly arranging items in a figure panel (e.g., in ImageJ: Aigouy and Mirouse, 2013; Mutterer and Zinck, 2013).

###### Color schemes, Encode data with color
"Color" is defined by three parameters: hue (red, green, blue etc), saturation (bright red, pale red), and lightness (dark-light) (Wong, 2010a). As a core preattentive attribute, color has an immediate impact on perception. When using color to represent quantities, it is crucial to choose a palette that accurately reflects the data (Gehlenborg and Wong, 2012; Hattab et al., 2020; Szafir, 2018). This is especially important when sequential colors are encoded with multi-color palettes. Oftentimes, jet or rainbow color palettes were used for this case, however these vary both the color as well as the lightness – the result are inhomogeneous perceived color changes (border effects), that do not faithfully represent the sequential chances in the data. Addressing this issue, new multi-hued palettes were developed, such as Viridis, which do not vary in lightness  (Smith and van der Walt, n.d.). A helpful tool for selecting data-encoding colors is Cynthia Brewer’s work, originally created for cartography but now widely used in various scientific fields (Brewer, n.d.; Harrower and Brewer, 2003).

When selecting color schemes consider tools like Paletton (https://paletton.com/) to pick harmonious or contrasting color combinations that enhance the visual appeal of your work. Tools and simulations are essential for verifying your colors work for all audiences. Note that color perception varies even among visually able audiences. Most computers have settings to simulate color blindness and greyscale, alternatively web-based tools are also available. Use WebAIM’s contrast checker to ensure a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5 to 1. Refer to previous work for more details on color accessibility for audiences and tasks (Hattab et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2021) and select harmonious or contrasting color schemes with tools like Paletton (https://paletton.com/).

###### On beauty
There is no formal framework for “beauty” in data visualization, nor research whether prettier charts are more insightful or memorable. However, the Gestalt principles help explain how we interpret patterns (Wertheimer, 1912). We naturally group objects based on similarity, proximity, or connection by lines. Symmetry also plays a key role, as symmetrical elements are perceived as belonging together. This principle is often applied in the organization of panel figures. In bar charts, ordering bars by quantity enhances both clarity and aesthetic appeal. By incorporating symmetry, we not only improve the effectiveness of a visualization but also make it more visually pleasing.
While beauty in visualization is subjective, the role of emotion is well-studied. Research shows that positive emotions elicited by a chart can boost user engagement (Kennedy and Hill, 2018) and data animations, designed to evoke emotions like joy or amusement, increase attention and interest (Lan et al., 2022).
Humans are also drawn to familiar visuals: charts incorporating images or pictograms—sometimes dismissed as "chart junk"—were found to be more re-recognizable in a large recall study (Borkin et al., 2013). And complementing text with relevant images can enhance memorability (Haroz et al., 2015) and likely increase user engagement.

##### FEEDBACK
###### The 1-second test: “What do you see first?”
Human visual perception is limited. This was first described by Miller (1956) as the "Magic Number 7," highlighting our ability to perceive a maximum of 7 visual elements at a time (Miller, 1956). Today, this is referred to as “chunking” in learning, and from human vision research we know that our eyes are biased towards certain features, so called preattentive attributes like color, size, or shape, that attract attention more easily (Wong, 2011d, 2010b). In figures, objects with most salience thus should be the most relevant (Canham and Hegarty, 2010; Hegarty et al., 2010).

###### Reverse feedback. Ask: “Explain to me what you see.”
Reverse feedback is similar to expert feedback, a method established in computer interface design (Shneiderman and Plaisant, 2010). In the laboratory setting, eye tracking may be used, while A/B testing compares different versions. Expert feedback allows authors to understand usability and potential issues (Tory and Moller, 2005) and is similar to heuristic evaluations, where usability principles are used to standardize evaluations (Zuk et al., 2006), similar to the figure checklist (Figure 1).

###### Focus the attention
Visual perception research, starting with Bauhaus defined Gestalt principles (Wertheimer, 1912) and evolving through Miller’s "Magic Number 7", shows that we process visual information in chunks (Johnson, 1970; Miller, 1956). Bertin expanded this and defined the simplest elements we see as the “pre-attentive attributes” (Bertin, 1967). Hubel and Wiesel studied the neurobiology of the visual system, which confirmed that basic cues such as color, orientation, size or motion are processed by neurons for in the visual cortex, while complex juxtapositions (e.g. charts) are integrated in a later stage of the brain (Barlow, 1982). Focusing on salient elements in figures, as Tufte suggests, aligns with how the brain processes visual data (Tufte, 2011).
