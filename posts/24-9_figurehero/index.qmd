#### A produce of this summer 
I had a lot of idle time this summer, waiting for children to return from their activities. Got the idea to finally [write up all the tips](https://osf.io/preprints/osf/xgbyr) I give students for improving their figures. 

#### Why improve figures
Figures are often packed with quantitative data and many biologists arenâ€™t taught how to design impactful data figures during their studies. My article provides those rapidly wanting to improve figures with a checklist to follow along. And those wanting to learn more with the scientific background why certain practices are good for effective visualizations.

The checklist.

#### Work-in-progress.. 
The article is still a preprint, feel free to suggest improvements!

I am happy to finally share with you that the summary of my Graphical Abstract blogs ([here ](../GraphicalAbstract_1/index.qmd), [here](../GraphicalAbstracts_2/index.qmd), [and here](../GraphicalAbstracts_3/GraphicalAbstracts.qmd) is now available as paper for you all to read and cite!
