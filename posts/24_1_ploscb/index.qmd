#### "Thank you for providing me with an exciting and informative read which was truly enjoyable."
Never have I ever had such great responses from reviewers - it was a joy to attend to the few very good suggestions they had for improving the manuscript! Reviewer 2 and 3 were similarly enthusiastic: "Congratulations for laying out your perspective." and "Overall, the paper is a beneficial guide for researchers looking to effectively communicate their research through graphical abstracts." A day to mark in my calendar! 

I am happy to finally share with you that the summary of my Graphical Abstract blogs is now available as paper for you all to share and cite!
