## Hidden image analysis
As a Research Data Scientist I engage in many different collaborative scientific projects, particularly focusing on the analysis of microscopy image data. Turning to the scientific literature, I noticed that image analysis methods were often absent or hidden by only briefly mentioning the used image analysis software in biological research papers. This made reproduction often very difficult. 

In publications image analysis is only one of many different methods scientists utilize. Although image analysis is increasingly taught in many courses at academic institutions, clear instructions or guidelines for the publication of image analysis in research papers were missing. This is one reason that is making it hard for authors to effectively publish good image analysis methods.

Two common image analysis tasks: measuring intensities and segmenting objects.

## Bringing image analysis into the light
Helena Jambor then started a fantastic effort within Quarep-LiMi to improve publications of microscopy images. She brought me in as a co-chair and together with many different scientists and experts in image analysis and microscopy we were able to distill core aspects of good image analysis methods in publications. We focused on giving practical and easy to execute advice in three different categories of image analysis methods that we commonly see used in research papers:
<ul>
<li>Established workflows</l>
<li>New workflows</l>
<li>Machine learning workflows</l>
</ul>

We hope that the checklist will enhance the work of scientists and make their life easier by giving clear and actionable instructions for the publication of images and image analysis.

Image data is transformed into results using image analysis workflows. In the literature we see that authors use established analysis workflows, new workflows and machine learning workflows. In our checklists we give essential advice on how to publish these methods.
