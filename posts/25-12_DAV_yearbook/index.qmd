## The *Data Vis Spring* Course Book

How do you turn raw data into something meaningful, informative, or eben beautiful? 
Have a look at the course book of the spring datavis class of 2025! 

### What’s inside

The book gathers a selection of projects created throughout the semester. Students had the choice of designing data for an interactive dashboards (to be completed in the next course) or infographic. 
Most projects were individual work and reflects a unique way of exploring real-world questions through visual means. And at times, the data collection and wrangling consumed most time. 

### Why this matters

Data visualization has become a language that connects science, society, and the public. It helps us understand complexity, spot patterns, and communicate ideas that would otherwise stay hidden in spreadsheets.
In our course, students learn not only the tools of analysis and design — they learn to think critically, make aesthetic decisions, and tell stories with data.

### What the students explored

The yearbook highlights an impressive range of topics. Some projects examine global issues like climate change, inequality, or public health. Others dive into personal data, cultural trends, or scientific datasets.
All of them take abstract numbers and transform them into visuals that invite reflection, reveal insight, or spark curiosity.

### A snapshot of a growing field

Thanks to the students who contributed their work, the course book shows how engaged, experimental, and responsible the next generation of data visualizers already is.
