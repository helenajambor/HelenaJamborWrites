## How to… image annotation
Image size, stainings and fluorphores (see next post) and symbols are not self-explanatory and should be described. 

## Where do annotations go?
Ideally the explanation is in the figure itself, close to the data on top of the image or next to it. Alternatively explanations can also be placed in the figure legend. If annotations are explained in the legend be aware that these not always on the same page as the image, consequently hard to find, or restricted in length by the publisher. Also consider that when many annotations are explained, figure legends become tedious to read.

## Color annotations
Colors may be explained with an annotation color-code like the data or or they can be referred to by name. Be super careful with unusual color names, not everyone is familiar with “lavender” or “salmon”. See a hilarious and very <a hreaf="https://blog.xkcd.com/2010/05/03/color-survey-results/">exhaustive analysis by XKCD</a>. And of course, just like your image colors, also your annotations should be color-blind save.

## Explain symbols and arrows
Oftentimes lines, arrows, symbols and regions of interest (ROIs) are used to point out important details or areas in an image. It is essential that all annotations are distinguishable and clearly explained. Avoid using the same symbol for several meanings: if arrows are used to point out structures, they should not concurrently be used to also indicate motion.

## Figure legends
Figure legends are an essential part of image annotation. Ideally they provide readers with an good idea of the specimen, preparation methods, dye etc and further essentials to understand the image. How this information is distributed between figure and figure legend, but also method section, depends on the journal requirement and personal preference, but in sum the information should make the figure self-explanatory.
A critical analysis by Yu of figure legends showed that up to 70% of the information needed to comprehend the figure was lacking, many times readers needed a complete paper to fully comprehend figures.
